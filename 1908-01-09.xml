                        <head>"THE CAP FITS."</head>
                        <p>When the correspondent of the " Daily Telegraph" informed the public that
                            H. H. the Khedive had expressed his regret that certain young Egyptians
                            should indulge in political agitation for the purpose of self ad-
                            vertisment, it was generally held that Mus- tapha Pasha Kamel and his
                            supporters were the objects of his Highness' criticism. The |
                            vationalist, or rather the extremist leader, left | us in no doubt as to
                            his opinions. His Earopean organs manifested considerable irritatio1, o
                            remarkable tactical blander, by the way, and asserted that the reported
                            interview had never taken place or was, at best, the work of a
                            correspondent whose accuracy was On &amp; pat with that of Mr. Dicey,
                            whose last interview with H. H, Abbas II was, as our readers will
                            remember, the subject of a semi-official d-meuti. "'Al Lewa" and its
                            European editors therefore denounced the "Daily Telegraph" as one of the
                            organs of a blood boltered capital- ism, derjded Mr. Dicey and
                            confidently pre- dicted a démenti, in terms which left no doubt onthe
                            mind of the reader that the non-ap- pearance of the démenti would cause
                            its Editor and hig party no small annoyance, Several days have elapsed
                            but no démenti has yet appeared and "Al Lewa" has published several of
                            the late Sheikh Mohamed ' Abdou's letters to Mr, Wilfrid Blunt in which
                            H. H. the Khedive 'is criticised with some severity by the Sheikh. Itis
                            to be presamed that this action on the part of Mustapha Pasha or his
                            brother, denotes the annoyance of the ex- tremists at the
                            non-appearance, of the expected contradiction. The letters have, we
                            believe, been published in the second volume of Mr. Blunt's work on
                            Egypt. Prudence or courtesy no doubt prevented their publication in the
                            Arabic Preas, and the Editors of "Al Lewa" must find some very ingenious
                            explanation of their publication of those documents, if they are to be
                            acquitted of the intention of display- ing their indignation at his
                            Highness' state- ments. If they -have merely. published them 4 titre de
                            curiosité' why did they not publish them before</p>
                        <p>The declarations attributed to his Highness are certainly explicit enough
                            and should have an excellent effect on many young Egyptians, who instead
                            of taking up professions of an honorable and useful natare prefer to
                            idle and prate concerning subjects of which they know nothing, save some
                            few catchwords. A painful instance of thia tendency is to be found in
                            the speech of Mahmond Bey Anis, on the occasion of the first, and we
                            trust the last, meating of the Nationalist Party. Here is a young man»
                            mentally an infant, who does does not know the first principle of
                            political oratory, viz that. you should not give your opponents a
                            handle. His speech, if its translation in the Earopean Editions of the
                            "Lewa" is to be accepted as accurate, and here again we have had no
                            démentis, is a concatenation of turgid phrases and rancid eulogies of
                            his chief. Mustapha Pasha Kamel is loved by all Egyptians, great and
                            small, high and low, unborn children and _ greybeards alike included.
                            His party: is 'God's Party' and consequently invincible and deserving of
                            every support that a patriot can give. Bless the youth ! Does he not
                            realixe that his description of The Almighty asa soit of patron-in-chief
                            of the extremist wing of the Nationalists borders on the blasphemous t
                            Does he suppose thatamong those who do not love Mustapha there are not a
                            few genuine Egyp- tians-par-sang, a matter of half a million Copts and
                            all the supporters of the Constitutional Reform league and the Party of
                            the People included? But we can only presume that the enchantment 'of
                            finding himself in the palace of "Al Lewa," a sort of Aladdin's cave,
                            was to much for the poor young man's self control. The building had
                            evidently been metamorphos- ed for the occasion by astroke of some en-
                            chanter's wand, for if Mustapha Pasha has succeeeded in changing a
                            military deserter into an unfortunate but gallant officer, and several
                            teachers of arithmetic and algebra in the vernacular into world-renowned
                            scientists, what prevents his effecting the transformation of the
                            offices of the 'Lewa" into an Egyptian Yildiz Kiosque, with Jinns for
                            printers' devils and Mamelukes in the place of his excellent Sudanese
                            boab. We wish we could find an equally powerful wand. </p>

                    <p>Mr. Frederic Ryan arrived yesterday after- noon in Cairo to occupy a position
                        as editor on the staff of "The Egyptian Standard". The organ gives vent to
                        the following ap- preciation of the new editor :— -</p>
                    <p>"Mr, Ryan is a young Irishman, well known in literary and political circles
                        in Dublin, } where for some time time he was the editor of a literary review
                        which numbered amongst its contributors the novelist George Moore, Mr. John
                        M. Robertson MP., Sir Horace Plunkett and other distinguished writers and
                        politi- cians. Mr. Ryan was subsequently joint editor of 'The National
                        Democrat," a monthly political review, which was strongly opposed to. the
                        conciliation-policy of Mr. O'Brien, Lord Dun- raven and other
                        Devolutionists. We take this opportunity of recording our pleasure at the
                        prospect of having such a valuable coadjutor in the campaign of the Egyptian
                        National Party."</p>

                    <p>REVIEW OF. TROOPS.</p>
                    <p>The review held yesterday morningin honourof the Khedive's Accession
                        Anniversary was very largely attended. All tickets for the carriage
                        enclosure were disposed of on the day of their issue and from nine o'clock
                        in the morning the road to Abbassia was crowded with a con- tinuous stream
                        of vehicles of every description, until at ten o'clock the whole frontage of
                        the parade ground was absolutely packed.</p>
                    <p>The beautiful weather of the past few days shewed no signs of failing and the
                        somewhat long wait before the arrival of the Khedive was deprived of the
                        chief terrors usual on such occasions, as it was neither too hot nor too
                        cold. The troops had. been assembled' in the parade ground for a full three
                        quarters of an hour when just after 10.80, the sharp call to "attention"
                        notified the crowds that his High- ness was approaching, and a moment later
                        the escort was seen advancing from the direction of Koubbeh. The Khedive,
                        accompanied by his aides-de-cawps first rode the length of the ground
                        returning the salutes of the occupants of the carriages, and then proceeded
                        to inspect the troops, the band in the meanwhile playing the Khedivial
                        Anthem,-and, the general inspec- tion finished, the lancers rode slowly past
                        for inspection and finally leaving the ground altogether took up their
                        position on the road outside. A general march past followed, the Infantry
                        leading and being followed -by: the cavalry aud gunners, all of which were
                        in perfect drill, as also was the mule battery which had its place in the
                        march -past. After returning to their original position at the Cairo end of
                        the ground, the infantry wheeled round to the centre and the cavalry and
                        gunners advanced in their former order at the double, then on reaching the
                        Koubbeh -end again some remarkably well performed wheel- ing movements were
                        indulged in before, at the word of command, they broke into the "gallop
                        past" with the gunners leading and the cavalry following at full gallop and
                        in per- fect order. It is not often that cheering is heard on 'an occasion
                        such as this but the excellence of the mantier in which this display was
                        carried out certainly justified the applause which greeted it.</p>
                    <p>Indeed the whole review can be looked upon as\a most successful one, for the
                        various | mancuvres were carried out briskly and in prompt succession to one
                        another, so that there was none of the "dragging" of time which is not
                        uncommon at military reviews. The review ended with cheers forhis Highness
                        by all the assembled troops, and the Khedive left the ground and returned to
                        Koubbeh.</p>
                    <p>As already announced the Khedivial recep- tion will not be held until the
                        Beiram, but nevertheless Cairo kept up the occasion in a royal manner, the
                        streets being ablaze with 'bunting and decorations of all kinds, the nar-
                        row street in front of Shepheard'a Hotel was |i particularly well done,
                        there being literally a dome of bunting for its entire length, while | |
                        from every window of the hotel itself a flag added to the general brightness
                        of the scene Opera Square was also very well decorated, the main frontage of
                        the Grand Continental Hotel being completely hidden by the flags of all
                        nations, with the Egyptian flag conspicuous. at every corner.</p>
                    <p>The streets were brilliantly illuminated at night and thousands of sightseers
                        paraded up P | and down the main thoroughfares until . a late '}honr.
                        Several stands bearing electric light illumination had been erected in the
                        Opera Square and the railings of the Esbekieh gardens were = mass of
                        glittering light.</p>
                    <p>The Khedive attended the opera in the evening, and subsequently drove out to
                        Koubbeh Palace amid the dense lines of people who for. a great part of the
                        distance, had 'assembled to -witness his departure.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday evening, the Wakfs Administra- tion and the Ulema Board,
                        Alexandria, cele- brated the Khedive's Accession Anniversary at the
                        Abou'el-Abbas Mosque when the Koran ayats were chanted and a chapter of

                    <p>MAP EXHIBITION.</p>
                    <p>The exhibition of maps and instruments which is to be opened to the public
                        to-day at the Geological Museum in Cairv is oné which should receive the
                        patronage of all who are in- terested in the progress and development of
                        this country, for in no way could the increase in the area of cultivable
                        land be more readily laid te- fore one than in the detailed maps which have
                        from time to time been issued by the Survey Department. The instrament room
                        is one off great interest, it is astonishing how many of the old methods of
                        map production have fallen into disuse through the increased facilities
                        which are now available in the way of mechanical ins truments both for field
                        work and computation. || In the first place there are the instraments for
                        the field, many of these being fitted with im- provements which were unheard
                        of a few years sitice, the instrament which is used for precise levelling
                        for instance, where one can read the staff and watch the position of the
                        bubble with- out a change of position, Then there are the machines which do
                        all the mechanical calcula- tions, such as multiplication, addition, and
                        sub- traction, while, this part of the work performed, there are the
                        co-ordinatograph pantograph and planimeter for plotting, reducing or
                        measuring the work on the maps. With*the former instru- ment it is possible
                        to plot the correct position of forty points per hour with a mean error not
                        exceeding 0.1 millimetre. By the use of the cal- culating machines the old
                        and tedious methods of logarithms and traverse tables are rendered
                        unnecessary, the new system also possessing the advantage of being
                        infinitely quicker thap the old, and Borrough's calcolating machine not only
                        performs additions but also prints the col- umns of figures as they are
                        added, with the to- tal at the end.</p>
                    <p>The first room also contains the field marks which are left by the surveyors
                        in order that the basis for a new survey may be readily made from any point
                        as it may become neces- sary, and it also contain an interesting series of
                        diagrams illustrating the triangulation of the second, third, and fourth
                        orders printed to various scales. In reference to these latter it is
                        interesting to know that all triangulations under the second order are
                        performed by Egyptians.</p>
                    <p>The second room is devoted to the methods | of production and utilization,
                        the whole of one wall being covered with a series shewing the different
                        stages, through which the maps pass before they are at length tarned out,
                        with co- lours and printing complete. The map chosen for the purpose is the
                        wall map to a scale of 1,200,000, shewing the Delta, Gizeh Mudirieh, and the
                        Fayoum, and which is specially suitable to the use of schools, The names
                        of places etc. are printed in Arabic, indeed all maps of this description
                        are printed either in English and Arabic or in Arabic alone. There is also
                        an instructive series for the use of primary school, these being printed to
                        different scales and each map having circular radius marked offin order to
                        enable the student to place the same position on maps of varying sizes and
                        scales. We understand that orders have already been received by the
                        Department for the supply of some of the 1: 2,000,000 scale maps to schools
                        in Cairo.</p>
                    <p>All the aluminium plates used for the re- production of colours, together
                        with the maps which have been-subjected to their application } | are also
                        exhibited in the second room, as are a series of maps illustrating their use
                        for sta- tistical and other purposes, among whichare to s | be found some of
                        morethan ordinary interestas showing the winter crops of 1905-6 in a portion
                        of the Qaliubieh Madirieh, while there are others far too numerous to
                        comment upon, -| though of almost equal interest as records of the manner in
                        which the land is apportioned to its various owners ete. etc</p>
                    <p>Topographical Survey is dealt with in the | .| tallest possible mannerin room
                        No. 3 where there are over sixty maps of various Maudiria, a provisional map
                        of the Kharga Oasis toa p | scale of 1 : 50,000 being of peculiar interest
                        at the present day when this almost unknown |; portion of Egypt is. about to
                        be brought with- in easy reach of the Valley:of the Nile by the opening of
                        the Western Oasis Railway next week.</p>
                    <p>Sheets from the surveyor's field book from the suryey of Alexandria town
                        shewing the _ } method of recording observations and measure- , | ments are
                        also to be seen in this room, original ' field maps, maps which have been
                        found to be _| faulty and which are now a nass of corrrec- _ | tions,
                        tracings of field maps, indeed all that is of any interest in topographical
                        survey work are deposited here, while in the next room s | maps of the
                        cadestral survey are exhibited in the same way.</p>
                    <p>The cadastral survey is practically complete for the whole of Egypt, and the'
                        specimens which are exhibited give a very good'idea of -|the method employed
                        in their production. | « Indeed the whole exhibition is planned ina manner
                        which enables the least technical of its - | visitors to comprehend the
                        scheme of things without difficulty, the work of the Survey De. partment is
                        of inestimable value tothe country, and the public should appreciate the
                        bpportu- '. | nity which is thus accorded them of inspecting g- | the work
                        and methods of the department. </p>
                    <p>We have only barely touched upon the chief - | of the exhibits in the
                        geological museum. but we trust that sufficient has been said to convince
                        the inhabitants of Cairo of the interest of the exhibition. The photographic
                        negatives which are. to be found in one of the upper rooms are real works of
                        art, and all the work compares most favourably with bat of the Ordnance

                    <head>AN EXCITING INCIDENT.</head>
                    <p>On Tuesday just after noon an incident, which might have had a very terrible
                        consequence, occurred on the Alexandria-Ramleh tram-line. An English nurse
                        with a baby was walking on the line between the Sporting Club and Mustapha
                        Pasha, and though the wattman clanged the bell loudly and continuously - the
                        attention of the nurse was not attracted until the tram was close upon her.
                        With a steep bank on one side it was a difficult matter to get out of the
                        road, and, seized with fright, the nurse dropped to the ground with the
                        child. The wattman, however, was prepared and drew up in time, so that
                        severe fright was the only suffering entailed by the incident. The policeman
                        attracted to the spot by the shoutss of those in the tramcar requested the
                        name of the nurse and her employé, but these were refused. We have at times
                        criticised the company's wattmans for careless driving, but this was purely
                        a case of the rights of the company being ignored by one of the public.
                        Blame can hardly be attached to the company when the public make unnecessary
                        use of the tram-line, and fail to keep their eyes open to the danger which
                        they know they are incurring.</p>

                    <p>Although the beginning of the season has been rather quieter than in other
                        years, the prospects for January and the following months are very
                        favourable. People speak about the crisis in America, but looking through
                        the orders of the Savoy Hotel its effect is not likely tobe great.

                    <p>Mr. Mackarness sends the following letter to the Editor of "The Daily News
                        :—</p>
                    <p>Sir,—The cause of humanity, from which the creed of Liberalism derives all
                        its in- spiration, is indebted to 'The. Daily News" for the way in which the
                        scandal of the Den- shawai trials has been exposed, and the liber ation
                        ofthe.sarviving prisoners persistently demanded. A further service hasbeen
                        added by your recent article tearing to pieces the flimsy pretence that the
                        Egyptian Government had anything to do either with the trial, the sentences,
                        or the release of the prisoners. As you well point out, everything that took
                        place was done under a ukase passed by the British Agent-General for the
                        supposed protection of the British Army, in express violation of the law of
                        Egypt and the most precions rights. of her citizens. Her judges were, set
                        aside, her juries abolished, and even the prerogative right of her Sovereign
                        to show clemency was treated with contempt.</p>
                    <p>The hangings and the floggings in the pre- sence of the friends of the
                        condemned can never be atoned for. For Governments and Ministers, as for
                        others, there aresome mistakes for which they can "find no place of
                        repentanée, though they seek it carefully with tears." What can be done is
                        to make impossible a repetition of such calamities, and it is to seeure this
                        that learnestly appeal for the co-operation ~| of your powerful paper.</p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer's new case, which supersedes the whole law and procedure of the
                        Egyptian Courts, and exposes the lives and liberties of the. Egyptians to
                        the unfettered discretion of a committee nominated by the British Agent-
                        General, still disfigures the statute book Until it is removed, there is no
                        guarantee that, under an access of panic, another Denishwai tragedy might
                        not be enacted. It is true that Sir Edward Grey has promised that he will be
                        no party to this law being put into operation. Buthe will _ | not be
                        for.ever in charge of affairs. As long as the law remains unrepealed, there
                        it lies, a weapon obsolete and barbarous, nodoubt, but one ready to the hand
                        of any terrified official in Egypt, who is short-sighted enough to sup- pose
                        that by the use of it he can make British rule more safe and more popular. I
                        hope that Liberals will not rest until this law has been got rid of, and
                        that 'he Daily News" will help us.</p>

                    <p>(From the "Daily Telegraph.)</p>
                    <p>The following is the full account of the inter- view briefly. summasised
                        incor special cable of the 2nd inst. It is the subject. of our leading
                        article in to-day's.issue.:—</p>
                    <p>His. Highness;.the, Khedive: has beeen:gra- ciougly pleased to.receive me,"
                        as -representa- tive of "The Daily Telegraph." Abbas. Hilmi, who was.looking
                        remarkably well; «and: was: in the best.of spirits, expressed . bimself.
                        as:being always delighted to receiveany foreigners who were really.
                        intereated : in, the. development of hiscountry. He-said that-he was
                        thoroughly satisfied with the progress Egypt was. making, and was convinced;
                        thati he and his . advisers were treading the right- path, bat that much yet
                        remained to be done.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the: finencial: situation,: the Khedive said. he was,
                        delighted: at the good sense. his. people. had shown. in.not., specujating
                        during: the recent.boom.. Thay: were-dependent on, their agricultural
                        labour, and, as. long: as their chief produce. was cotton, and the present
                        price was maintained, the prosperity of the country must increase, a8 the,
                        area ander cul- tivation was eye widening</p>
                    <p>He remarked: on, the Aiteceoce 3 in the appearance.of the suburb Abbassia
                        now and its appearance when hecame to. the.throne fifteen years ago; then
                        it wasall-gardens and. waste land, now it was covered by villas, blocks of
                        flats, and sbops, all of which represented solid wealth. His Highness was
                        very.emphatic in. expressing his delight . at. having. Six Eldon Gorst once
                        more in Egypt. Sir. Eldon, he. said had. been in hifi service both
                        as.adviser to. the: Minister of the Interior, .and. adviser to the.
                        Minister: of Finance; and was'therefore thoroughly aequaint- ed with the
                        administrative machinery. of the country. He remarked on the sympathetic and
                        enlightened interest which. Sir Eldon Gorst took in the country,
                        particularly drawing atten- tion to his late journey through Lower Egypt,
                        and his visit to. Upper Egypt and. the Soudan.</p>
                    <p>His. Highness went on to say that he was very proud of the progress the
                        Egyptian was. making,in education, and that he was certain there were
                        no.people who were more quick at learning. Egypt never. lacked able men. He
                        dwelt on the services that Nubar Pasba,, Riaz Pasha, and Mustapha Pasha
                        Fehmi had render- ed their country, and the way all the seriously- minded
                        Egyptians emphasised the common end they had in view by rallying round his
                        Highness on all public ocyasions. He deeply deplored the tendency shown by a
                        few of the yoanger Egyp- tians to seek self-advertisement rather than the
                        improvement of their country by legitimate means. He was, however,
                        delighted. that all agitation was dying-out. His Highness remark- ed that
                        the Egyptian had so charming a cha- racter that all agitations soon came to
                        a natural end. He emphasised the entire absence of fana ticism, but said
                        that all people should respect the religious prejudices of others.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the Soudan, the Khedive said that it was an entirely different
                        country and could not be governed by the same methods as as Egypt ; he had
                        every confidence in the Sir- dar and his staff, and was delighted at the
                        very material progress made daoring the last few years. His Highness
                        regarded with great grati- fication the real material 'and moral improve-
                        ment in the condition of the people he loved so well, which had been
                        achieved in the fifteen years-of his reign.</p>
                    <p>Abbas Hilmi then went on to discuss politi- cal events in England, in which
                        he takes the very keenest interest, particularly in the Socia- lists'
                        campaign On terminating the audience the Khedive said how delighted he was
                        at Lord Cromer's reeovery, and he hoped that one win- ter he might re-visit
                        Egypt.</p>

                    <p>A PIGMY BROUGHT TO EGYPT.</p>
                    <p>About the year 2500 B.C. a prince of Elephantime named Herkhuf made up his
                        mind to penetrate farther towards the mysté- rions lands -of the south. It
                        is forty-four centu- ries sincé he set out over the desert, with the wind
                        whistling past his ears and the powerful sun warming his bone and his heart
                        within him; yet the story of his adventures may still be read, the path by
                        which he travelled may atill be discerned, and the names of his captains may
                        still be seen on the rocks of the land of Arthet. Herkhof, having obtained
                        the necessary order from the Pharaon, set out with his father Ara, "in
                        order," ashe says, "to explore a road to the country of Aam." The.road which
                        he explored and opened up was. probably a continuation of the route from
                        Elephantine to Arthet, passing not far back from the river, and descending
                        to the water between Abu Simbel and Wady Halfa in the heart of the land of
                        Aam. The expedition was entirely successful, and Herkhuf states that he was
                        "very. greatly. praised. for it." Emboldened by the fame which his
                        enterprise had brought him, be made a second expedition. to Aam, and
                        was.gone from Egypt eight months. A third excusion was more adventurous.
                        Herkhuf set out upon the "Oasis Road," which runs from a point north ofAswan
                        to Kurkur Oasis, and thence. branches to Tomas or Arthet and to the Oasis of
                        Khargeh which lies westward, and which in those days was inhabited by |
                        Libyan tribes. At the Kurkur junction Har- khuf met with an army under the
                        leadership of the Prince of Aam, which was on its way to chastise these
                        Libyans ; but how the wily Egyptians contrived to use it instead asan escort
                        to his own men. back to Aam, and how he returned to Egypt through the
                        hostile territory of Sethu, Arthet, and Wawat, with three hundred asses
                        laden with the presents of his host, are tales too long to narrate here.</p>
                    <p>THE KING AND THE PIGMY.</p>
                    <p>One story only may be recorded in this ar- ticle. During a fourth expedition
                        to Aam, Herkhuf had managed to obtain one of the dwarfs or pigmies who
                        inhabited a regiou of the Land of the Ghosts. He at once informed the king,
                        now the boy Pepy II ; and in reply he received the following letter,-which
                        is, per- haps, the earliest example in the world's history of a private
                        communication :—</p>
                    <p>"T have noted," writes the King, "the mat- ter of your letter which you have
                        sent me, in order that I might know that you have re- turned in safety from
                        Aam, with the army which was with you. . . . You say in your let- ter that
                        you have brought a dancing pigmy of the god from the Land of the Ghosts,
                        like the pigmy which the Treasurer Baurded brought from the Land of Pount in
                        the time of Asesa You say to my majesty, 'Never before has one like him béen
                        brought by any one who has visited Aam.' . . Come northward, .therefere, to
                        the court immediately, and bring this pigmy with you, which you must bring
                        living, pros perous, and healthy, from the Land of the Ghosts, to dance for
                        the king and to rejoice and gladden the heart of the king. ... My majesty
                        desires to see this pigmy more than the gifts of Sinai and of Pount. If you
                        arrive at court, the pigmy being with you, alive, prosperous, and healthy,
                        my majesty will do for yon a greater thing than that which was done for the
                        Treasurer Baurded in the time ot Asesa, according to the heart's desire of
                        my majesty to see this pigmy. Orders have been sent to the chief of the New
                        Town to arrange that food shall be taken from every store-city and every"

                    <p>These two volumes, the first; by H. Saladin, devoted to architecture, the

                        have gained ; even the plans, which are numerous and most valuable, are
                        occasionally marred by over-reduction, making the lettering an irritation:to
                        decipher. But, on the whole, the illustration is excellent in quality, as
                        well as abandant, though the historical portions would. have. benefited by
                        maps—not many ordinary readers can "place" with surety such sites as Diafoul

                        <p>The Money Market.</p>
                        <p>It is a good omen so far as the money mar- ket'is concerned that the year
                            has opened with very bright prospects. The outlook: for the fa- ture
                            seems brighter than for 4 long time past, and the stérm clouds are now
                            rapidly disper- sing. The last two months have been anxious ones to the
                            Bank of England, and have caused no little inconvenience to the
                            financial comma- nity generally, but the reduction of the Bank rate to 6
                            percent. which was made yesterday, may be accepted as indicating that
                            the chances _ of further trouble are remote.</p>
                        <p>Among some of the most conservative bank- ers the step taken by the Bank
                            yesterday caus- ed a little surprise, as it was felt that the di-
                            rectors, following up their well-justified policy of caution, might
                            probably wait a week or two longer to see what developments the torn of
                            the; year might bring. For the most part, however: the reduction was
                            fully expected. This week's: Bank return appears to justify the line
                            taken. The reserve has further risen one-and-three quarter millions,
                            bringing the total up to near- ly twentyone and a half millions. The
                            situation: in America is also considerably improved, and there is little
                            likelihood that further shipments: of gold will now be necessary.
                            Moreover, it is probable:that gold will shortly be returning from Egypt,
                            and the next few weeks should al- so see the return of a proportion of
                            the'precious metal sent to the States.</p>
                        <p>The Bank return shows that the stock of coin and bullion is up
                            £1,79%,000, all of which, with the exception of about half a million,
                            came back from the provinces. The net addition to the reserve is
                            £1,792,000, bringing the total to £21,473,'.00, which com- pares with
                            £19,689,000 a year ago. The pro- portion to liabilities has declined 44
                            per cent., to 35% percent. In the corresponding week of 1907 the
                            proportion was 334 per cent The reduction in the Bank rate has brought
                            about an appreciable decline in discount rates, and the rate for three
                            months' bills is now about 4455.</p>
                        <p>The pressure incidental to the end of the year and the Consols
                            "carry-over" caused an extensive demand for short loans at the begin-
                            ning of the week, and the Bank did a very large business at 7} per
                            cent., whilst in the outside market as much as 8 per cent. was paid on
                            Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday there was again a good demand for short loans in connection
                            with repayments to the Bank at 44 to 4} per cent., and weekly
                            accomodation realised 4}.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="bold">Silver.</hi></p>
                        <p>After being easier on Saturday, the silver market has shown: a better
                            tone this week, and the quotations have advanced to 25%. for. im-
                            mediate and 25, 5/'6 for forward delivery.</p>
                        <p>The Stook Markets.</p>
                        <p>As if to atone tor.the laxity displayed during the year, the stock
                            markets signalised the close of 1907 with a burst of activity in all de-
                            partments, and prices showed a rapid advance. Subsequent events seem to
                            indicate, however, that the business transacted was largely ofa
                            professional order, and was carried through with the idea of bringing in
                            the support of the public. The move does not appear to have been
                            successful,and investors have not respond- ed with the heartiness which
                            is usually lgoked for atthe New Year. Of course the present week has not
                            been a good one for business. The closing of the "house" on Wednesday
                            was a disturbing influence, and the bright, sharp weather, seems to have
                            induced many people to prolong their holidays fora few days.</p>
                        <p>The outlook forthe New Year is anything bot unsatisfactory. There is good
                            promise of much easier money conditions, which should | cause capital
                            which has 'been let out at dis- count to be invested in stocks and
                            shares, and thére are also signs that one or two trades which have
                            absorbed a large amount of money during the past two or three years
                            are.nearing the end of the boom. The Lancashire cotton trade
                            is-anexample. Although the spinners are stil doing well, the owners of
                            weaving mills are finding difficulty in obtaining orders, and
                            "short-time" has become general in several districts. All this should
                            help the market for stocks and shares.</p>
                        <p>The prospects for Egyptians are good, and things look like going 'better.
                            It is probable that the banks will again extend credit on the | best
                            securities when the financing of the cotton is completed.</p>
                        <p>Consoils</p>
                        <p>The market for gilt-edged stocks was very buoyant on Saturday, and again
                            on Monday and Tuesday, and the quotation for Console advanced 4, the
                            fact that the Bank was success- ful in obtaining. million in bar gold in
                            the open market being # helping factor.</p>
                        <p>To-night Consols close without change.</p>

                            of the week, and the tone also opened firm yesterday: on the reductioh

                            was some buying of them at. the beginning at 12, 15/16—{. They

                            which put the price up, upon which Egypt took the oppor- tunity to sell
                            a packet of shares, which, how- ever were all absorbed by themarket. We
                            have reliable authority for saying the position of this company is
                            extremely good. They have a considerable sum in cash on deposit ia

                            Bank shares at the end of the year was rather dull, but since the
                            opening of the New Yearand thé reduction of the Bank of England rate

                            is doing an enorm- ous business, its reputation having been largely
                            increased during the financial crisis, and we thivk it by no means
                            improbable there will be an increased coupon this year. Agriculturals
                            seem rather doll, although they are firm, and appear to find support.

                            favour of this coantry since this time last year. They close at 7}%, +4,

                        <p>There seems to be a steady stream of liqni- idation in United' Egyptian
                            Lands, owing to the closing out of weak accounts which mostly 'emanates
                            from Egypt. Several large packets were uffered at between 4/6 aud 5/-.,
                            but the ucarket here in them has dried up. The present price of these
                            shares would represent a loss of 75% on the company's issued capital and

                            energetic working mason. His health, at' one "time precarious, has been
                            completely re-estab- lished, thanks to the treatment of Dr. Will- |

                            of his fellow-workmen.</p>
                        <p>"For six months," writes M. Jonillat, "my health left a lot to be
                            desired. 1. was -very mach troubled.in my work on account-of~my
                            sufferings and-my growing weakness. I suffered through acute stomach
                            trouble, and. I .weak- ened because my impaired organa failedxto nourish
                            me sufficiently and to recompenseme for the loss of strength which-each
                            day's work entailed. I was, therefore, always indis- posed. I was often
                            seized with giddiness, which for a mason working. or a scaffold, is
                            naturally a very serious complaint. I also.had persistent sick headaches
                            and neuralgia. At night» slept very badly and got. scarcely any. rest.
                            In spite of all the medicines which I was made | to take,my stomach
                            troubles remained uncured. Happily, however, I was at last advised to
                            take Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, and these havedone me
                            agreat deal of 'good. | From the first box.I obtained a much improved:
                            appetite, and digested my food considerably better. I quickly regained:
                            my-strength, and | my. complete cure was very rapid."</p>
                        <p>Dr. Williams' Pink Pills.are an excellent | remedy for overworked
                            .stomachs—stomachs too weak to: digest food, and, therefore-:in=
                            sufficiently nourishing. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills' for Pale People
                            impart to the stomach, the. force which it lacks, because they enrich
                            impoverished blood,-and; because: the zich blood which they cause
                            tefreely circulate in the veins carries to all the organs including-the
                            stomach, the strength which has to be replaced. Thay are also a cure for
                            anemia, chlorosis, sick headaches, neuralgia, general weakness, and

                    <p>La Cour d'Appel Mixte vient dese pronon- cer sur une trés intéressante
                        question de prin- cipe en matiére decomptes-oourants en banque. 'Tl
                        sagissait desavoir si un établissement de crédit ou tout autre créancier
                        gagiste avait, le droit de faire vendre le gage dra que la marge devenait
                        insuffisante 4 lui garantir son avance. Ce qui ajoutait de Vintérét a cette
                        question cest bien natorellement la situation générale de la bourse des
                        valeurs et surtout une ordon- nance rendue récemment par le tribonal dans
                        une affaire analogue od le premier juge avait déclaré que le créancier
                        gagiste n'avait pas le droit de faire vendre aux enchéres, parce que, la
                        vente ne pouvant etre motivée que par Un danger réel, il ne croyait pas que
                        les prix pus- sent baisser encore. Depuis lors, les faits, ¢'est- 4-dire la
                        baisse des cours, sont venus démentir cette assertion.</p>
                    <p>En Vespéce il s'agit d'un employé des Douanes Egyptiennes, M. J. 'Abaouat,
                        sujet local demeurant a Alexandrie, qui s'était fait ouvrir un
                        compte-courant au Crédit Lyon- nais et dont la marge devenue insuffisante
                        avait obligée la banque 4A appliquer ses régle- ments.</p>
                    <p>En premiere instance le juge avait fixé pour la vente un délai au risque,
                        ainsi quecela semble sétre vérifié en l'espece, de voir diminuer la valeur
                        du gage et empirer par suite la situation du débiteur. C'est contre ce
                        premier jugement que le.Crédit Lyonnais avait fait appel.</p>
                    <p>Contrairement 4 l'exception soulevée par J. Abaouat, la Coura retena que le
                        non-commer- gant qui se fait ouvrir un compte-courant dans les conditions
                        ordinaires de la place,est réputé, du moins a priori, avoir fait acte de
                        commerce, A défaut de toute convention contraire. Sur cela il ne peut y
                        avoir de doute.</p>
                    <p>Tout Vintérét du débat se résume dans les modes de preave du contrat et du
                        maximum des intéréts de réaliaation du gage, ainsi que dans la compétence.
                        da tribunal appelé a con- naitre des. contestations relatives au solde du
                        compte. A ce point de vue, celui qui sans autre spécification se fait ouvrir
                        uu compte courant nanti d'un gage est suppoad s'étre soumis par le fait
                        m@éme 4 des conditions &amp; défaut des- quelles il n'aurait pu obtenir
                        aucune.avance.</p>
                    <p>Sur la question de délai, la Cour, a déclaré Vappel recevable, infirmé le
                        jugement attaqueé et décidé que la vente dont s'agit se ferait dans les
                        trois jours qui suivront l'apposition des affiches et la date des
                        insertions. J. Abaouat a été de plus condamné aux dépens des deux
                        degrés.</p>

                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. </p>
                    <p>Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather
                        in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is
                        Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers of the P.&amp;O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                        Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                        British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                        steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change
                        in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to Marseilles
                        and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., have
                        also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected and sent to any
                        address.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail<cb n="6"/> Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                        leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian
                        mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                            rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Menaggio</hi> with the prettily-situated town of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bellaggio</hi> opposite. The walk from <hi rend="italic">Tremezzo</hi>
                        along the shore of the lake to <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most
                        enjoyable. A steam tram runs from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi
                            rend="italic">Porlezza</hi> on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour,
                        then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are
