                    <p><hi rend="bold">“THE CAP FITS.”</hi></p>

                    <p>When the correspondent of the “ Daily Telegraph” informed the public that H.
                        H. the Khedive had expressed his regret that certain young Egyptians should
                        indulge in political agitation for the purpose of self ad- vertisment, it
                        was generally held that Mus- tapha Pasha Kamel and his supporters were the
                        objects of his Highness’ criticism. The | vationalist, or rather the
                        extremist leader, left | us in no doubt as to his opinions. His Earopean
                        organs manifested considerable irritatio1, o remarkable tactical blander, by
                        the way, and asserted that the reported interview had never taken place or
                        was, at best, the work of a correspondent whose accuracy was On &amp; pat
                        with that of Mr. Dicey, whose last interview with H. H, Abbas II was, as our
                        readers will remember, the subject of a semi-official d-meuti. “‘Al Lewa”
                        and its European editors therefore denounced the “Daily Telegraph” as one of
                        the organs of a blood boltered capital- ism, derjded Mr. Dicey and
                        confidently pre- dicted a démenti, in terms which left no doubt onthe mind
                        of the reader that the non-ap- pearance of the démenti would cause its
                        Editor and hig party no small annoyance, Several days have elapsed but no
                        démenti has yet appeared and “Al Lewa” has published several of the late
                        Sheikh Mohamed ' Abdou’s letters to Mr, Wilfrid Blunt in which H. H. the
                        Khedive ‘is criticised with some severity by the Sheikh. Itis to be presamed
                        that this action on the part of Mustapha Pasha or his brother, denotes the
                        annoyance of the ex- tremists at the non-appearance, of the expected
                        contradiction. The letters have, we believe, been published in the second
                        volume of Mr. Blunt’s work on Egypt. Prudence or courtesy no doubt prevented
                        their publication in the Arabic Preas, and the Editors of “Al Lewa” must
                        find some very ingenious explanation of their publication of those
                        documents, if they are to be acquitted of the intention of display- ing
                        their indignation at his Highness’ state- ments. If they -have merely.
                        published them 4 titre de curiosité’ why did they not publish them
                        before</p>

                    <p>The declarations attributed to his Highness are certainly explicit enough and
                        should have an excellent effect on many young Egyptians, who instead of
                        taking up professions of an honorable and useful natare prefer to idle and
                        prate concerning subjects of which they know nothing, save some few
                        catchwords. A painful instance of thia tendency is to be found in the speech
                        of Mahmond Bey Anis, on the occasion of the first, and we trust the last,
                        meating of the Nationalist Party. Here is a young man» mentally an infant,
                        who does does not know the first principle of political oratory, viz that.
                        you should not give your opponents a handle. His speech, if its translation
                        in the Earopean Editions of the “Lewa” is to be accepted as accurate, and
                        here again we have had no démentis, is a concatenation of turgid phrases and
                        rancid eulogies of his chief. Mustapha Pasha Kamel is loved by all
                        Egyptians, great and small, high and low, unborn children and _ greybeards
                        alike included. His party: is ‘God’s Party’ and consequently invincible and
                        deserving of every support that a patriot can give. Bless the youth ! Does
                        he not realixe that his description of The Almighty asa soit of
                        patron-in-chief of the extremist wing of the Nationalists borders on the
                        blasphemous t Does he suppose thatamong those who do not love Mustapha there
                        are not a few genuine Egyp- tians-par-sang, a matter of half a million Copts
                        and all the supporters of the Constitutional Reform league and the Party of
                        the People included? But we can only presume that the enchantment ‘of
                        finding himself in the palace of “Al Lewa,” a sort of Aladdin’s cave, was to
                        much for the poor young man’s self control. The building had evidently been
                        metamorphos- ed for the occasion by astroke of some en- chanter’s wand, for
                        if Mustapha Pasha has succeeeded in changing a military deserter into an
                        unfortunate but gallant officer, and several teachers of arithmetic and
                        algebra in the vernacular into world-renowned scientists, what prevents his
                        effecting the transformation of the offices of the ‘Lewa” into an Egyptian
                        Yildiz Kiosque, with Jinns for printers’ devils and Mamelukes in the place
                        of his excellent Sudanese boab. We wish we could find an equally powerful
                        wand. </p>

                    <p><hi rend="bold">REVIEW OF. TROOPS.</hi></p>

                    <p>The review held yesterday morningin honourof the Khedive’s Accession
                        Anniversary was very largely attended. All tickets for the carriage
                        enclosure were disposed of on the day of their issue and from nine o'clock
                        in the morning the road to Abbassia was crowded with a con- tinuous stream
                        of vehicles of every description, until at ten o’clock the whole frontage of
                        the parade ground was absolutely packed.</p>

                    <p>The beautiful weather of the past few days shewed no signs of failing and the
                        somewhat long wait before the arrival of the Khedive was deprived of the
                        chief terrors usual on such occasions, as it was neither too hot nor too
                        cold. The troops had. been assembled’ in the parade ground for a full three
                        quarters of an hour when just after 10.80, the sharp call to “attention”
                        notified the crowds that his High- ness was approaching, and a moment later
                        the escort was seen advancing from the direction of Koubbeh. The Khedive,
                        accompanied by his aides-de-cawps first rode the length of the ground
                        returning the salutes of the occupants of the carriages, and then proceeded
                        to inspect the troops, the band in the meanwhile playing the Khedivial
                        Anthem,-and, the general inspec- tion finished, the lancers rode slowly past
                        for inspection and finally leaving the ground altogether took up their
                        position on the road outside. A general march past followed, the Infantry
                        leading and being followed -by: the cavalry aud gunners, all of which were
                        in perfect drill, as also was the mule battery which had its place in the
                        march -past. After returning to their original position at the Cairo end of
                        the ground, the infantry wheeled round to the centre and the cavalry and
                        gunners advanced in their former order at the double, then on reaching the
                        Koubbeh -end again some remarkably well performed wheel- ing movements were
                        indulged in before, at the word of command, they broke into the “gallop
                        past” with the gunners leading and the cavalry following at full gallop and
                        in per- fect order. It is not often that cheering is heard on ‘an occasion
                        such as this but the excellence of the mantier in which this display was
                        carried out certainly justified the applause which greeted it.</p>

                    <p>Indeed the whole review can be looked upon as\a most successful one, for the
                        various | mancuvres were carried out briskly and in prompt succession to one
                        another, so that there was none of the “dragging” of time which is not
                        uncommon at military reviews. The review ended with cheers forhis Highness
                        by all the assembled troops, and the Khedive left the ground and returned to
                        Koubbeh.</p>

                    <p>As already announced the Khedivial recep- tion will not be held until the
                        Beiram, but nevertheless Cairo kept up the occasion in a royal manner, the
                        streets being ablaze with ‘bunting and decorations of all kinds, the nar-
                        row street in front of Shepheard’a Hotel was |i particularly well done,
                        there being literally a dome of bunting for its entire length, while | |
                        from every window of the hotel itself a flag added to the general brightness
                        of the scene Opera Square was also very well decorated, the main frontage of
                        the Grand Continental Hotel being completely hidden by the flags of all
                        nations, with the Egyptian flag conspicuous. at every corner.</p>

                    <p>The streets were brilliantly illuminated at night and thousands of sightseers
                        paraded up P | and down the main thoroughfares until . a late ‘}honr.
                        Several stands bearing electric light illumination had been erected in the
                        Opera Square and the railings of the Esbekieh gardens were = mass of
                        glittering light.</p>

                    <p>The Khedive attended the opera in the evening, and subsequently drove out to
                        Koubbeh Palace amid the dense lines of people who for. a great part of the
                        distance, had ‘assembled to -witness his departure.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday evening, the Wakfs Administra- tion and the Ulema Board,
                        Alexandria, cele- brated the Khedive’s Accession Anniversary at the
                        Abou'el-Abbas Mosque when the Koran ayats were chanted and a chapter of
                        the}: “Hedith’ read.- The ceremony was attended “| by a large number of
                        Ulema, Sheikhs and notables.</p>

                    <p>The exhibition of maps and instruments which is to be opened to the public
                        to-day at the Geological Museum in Cairv is oné which should receive the
                        patronage of all who are in- terested in the progress and development of
                        this country, for in no way could the increase in the area of cultivable
                        land be more readily laid te- fore one than in the detailed maps which have
                        from time to time been issued by the Survey Department. The instrament room
                        is one off great interest, it is astonishing how many of the old methods of
                        map production have fallen into disuse through the increased facilities
                        which are now available in the way of mechanical ins truments both for field
                        work and computation. || In the first place there are the instraments for
                        the field, many of these being fitted with im- provements which were unheard
                        of a few years sitice, the instrament which is used for precise levelling
                        for instance, where one can read the staff and watch the position of the
                        bubble with- out a change of position, Then there are the machines which do
                        all the mechanical calcula- tions, such as multiplication, addition, and
                        sub- traction, while, this part of the work performed, there are the
                        co-ordinatograph pantograph and planimeter for plotting, reducing or
                        measuring the work on the maps. With*the former instru- ment it is possible
                        to plot the correct position of forty points per hour with a mean error not
                        exceeding 0.1 millimetre. By the use of the cal- culating machines the old
                        and tedious methods of logarithms and traverse tables are rendered
                        unnecessary, the new system also possessing the advantage of being
                        infinitely quicker thap the old, and Borrough’s calcolating machine not only
                        performs additions but also prints the col- umns of figures as they are
                        added, with the to- tal at the end.</p>

                    <p>The first room also contains the field marks which are left by the surveyors
                        in order that the basis for a new survey may be readily made from any point
                        as it may become neces- sary, and it also contain an interesting series of
                        diagrams illustrating the triangulation of the second, third, and fourth
                        orders printed to various scales. In reference to these latter it is
                        interesting to know that all triangulations under the second order are
                        performed by Egyptians.</p>

                    <p>The second room is devoted to the methods | of production and utilization,
                        the whole of one wall being covered with a series shewing the different
                        stages, through which the maps pass before they are at length tarned out,
                        with co- lours and printing complete. The map chosen for the purpose is the
                        wall map to a scale of 1,200,000, shewing the Delta, Gizeh Mudirieh, and the
                        Fayoum, and which is specially suit- able to the use of schools, The names
                        of places etc. are printed in Arabic, indeed all maps of this description
                        are printed either in English and Arabic or in Arabic alone. There is also
                        an instructive series for the use of primary school, these being printed to
                        different scales and each map having circular radius marked offin order to
                        enable the student to place the same position on maps of varying sizes and
                        scales. We understand that orders have already been received by the
                        Department for the supply of some of the 1: 2,000,000 scale maps to schools
                        in Cairo.</p>

                    <p>All the aluminium plates used for the re- production of colours, together
                        with the maps which have been-subjected to their application } | are also
                        exhibited in the second room, as are a series of maps illustrating their use
                        for sta- tistical and other purposes, among whichare to s | be found some of
                        morethan ordinary interestas showing the winter crops of 1905-6 in a portion
                        of the Qaliubieh Madirieh, while there are others far too numerous to
                        comment upon, -| though of almost equal interest as records of the manner in
                        which the land is apportioned to its various owners ete. etc</p>

                    <p>Topographical Survey is dealt with in the | .| tallest possible mannerin room
                        No. 3 where there are over sixty maps of various Maudiria, a provisional map
                        of the Kharga Oasis toa p | scale of 1 : 50,000 being of peculiar interest
                        at the present day when this almost unknown |; portion of Egypt is. about to
                        be brought with- in easy reach of the Valley:of the Nile by the opening of
                        the Western Oasis Railway next week.</p>

                    <p>Sheets from the surveyor's field book from the suryey of Alexandria town
                        shewing the _ } method of recording observations and measure- , | ments are
                        also to be seen in this room, original ' field maps, maps which have been
                        found to be _| faulty and which are now a nass of corrrec- _ | tions,
                        tracings of field maps, indeed all that is of any interest in topographical
                        survey work are deposited here, while in the next room s | maps of the
                        cadestral survey are exhibited in the same way.</p>

                    <p>The cadastral survey is practically complete for the whole of Egypt, and the’
                        specimens which are exhibited give a very good’idea of -|the method employed
                        in their production. | « Indeed the whole exhibition is planned ina manner
                        which enables the least technical of its - | visitors to comprehend the
                        scheme of things without difficulty, the work of the Survey De. partment is
                        of inestimable value tothe country, and the public should appreciate the
                        bpportu- ’. | nity which is thus accorded them of inspecting g- | the work
                        and methods of the department. </p>

                    <p>We have only barely touched upon the chief - | of the exhibits in the
                        geological museum. but we trust that sufficient has been said to convince
                        the inhabitants of Cairo of the interest of the exhibition. The photographic
                        negatives which are. to be found in one of the upper rooms are real works of
                        art, and all the work compares most favourably with bat of the Ordnance
                        Survey of England, and when it is considered that this has, in great part,
                        been accomplished .| in a remarkably short space of time, and by the</p>

                    <p>On Toesday “just after noon an incident, which might bave had a very terrible
                        con- sequence, occurred on the Alexandria-Ramleh tram-line. An English nurse
                        with a baby’ was walking on the line between the Sporting Club | § and
                        Mustapha Pasha, and though the wattman clanged the bell loudly and
                        continuously - the attention of the nurse was not attracted until the-tram
                        was close.apon her. With a steep bank on one side it-was a diffoult matter
                        to get out of the road, and, seized with fright, the nyrse.dropped to the
                        ground ‘with the child. The -wattman, however, was prepared and | | drew up
                        in time, so that severe fright was the only suffering entailed by the
                        incident. The policeman attracted to the spot by the shouts | 's of those iu
                        the tramcar requested the name of the nurse aud her employé, but these were
                        refused. We have at times criticised the com- pany’s wattmans for careless
                        driving, but this was purely a case of the rights of the company being
                        ignored by one of the public. Blame can hardly be attached to the company
                        when the public make unnecessary use of the tram-line, and fail to keep
                        their eyes open to the danger which they know they are incurring.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Mackarness sends the following letter to the Editor of “The Daily News
                        :—</p>

                    <p>Sir,—The cause of humanity, from which the creed of Liberalism derives all
                        its in- spiration, is indebted to ‘The. Daily News” for the way in which the
                        scandal of the Den- shawai trials has been exposed, and the liber ation
                        ofthe.sarviving prisoners persistently demanded. A further service hasbeen
                        added by your recent article tearing to pieces the flimsy pretence that the
                        Egyptian Government had anything to do either with the trial, the sentences,
                        or the release of the prisoners. As you well point out, everything that took
                        place was done under a ukase passed by the British Agent-General for the
                        supposed protection of the British Army, in express violation of the law of
                        Egypt and the most precions rights. of her citizens. Her judges were, set
                        aside, her juries abolished, and even the prerogative right of her Sovereign
                        to show clemency was treated with contempt.</p>

                    <p>The hangings and the floggings in the pre- sence of the friends of the
                        condemned can never be atoned for. For Governments and Ministers, as for
                        others, there aresome mistakes for which they can “find no place of
                        repentanée, though they seek it carefully with tears.” What can be done is
                        to make impossible a repetition of such calamities, and it is to seeure this
                        that learnestly appeal for the co-operation ~| of your powerful paper.</p>

                    <p>Lord Cromer’s new case, which supersedes the whole law and procedure of the
                        Egyptian Courts, and exposes the lives and liberties of the. Egyptians to
                        the unfettered discretion of a committee nominated by the British Agent-
                        General, still disfigures the statute book Until it is removed, there is no
                        guarantee that, under an access of panic, another Denishwai tragedy might
                        not be enacted. It is true that Sir Edward Grey has promised that he will be
                        no party to this law being put into operation. Buthe will _ | not be
                        for.ever in charge of affairs. As long as the law remains unrepealed, there
                        it lies, a weapon obsolete and barbarous, nodoubt, but one ready to the hand
                        of any terrified official in Egypt, who is short-sighted enough to sup- pose
                        that by the use of it he can make British rule more safe and more popular. I
                        hope that Liberals will not rest until this law has been got rid of, and
                        that ‘he Daily News” will help us.</p>

                        article in to-day’s.issue.:—</p>

                    <p>His. Highness;.the, Khedive: has beeen:gra- ciougly pleased to.receive me,”
                        as -representa- tive of “The Daily Telegraph.” Abbas. Hilmi, who was.looking
                        remarkably well; «and: was: in the best.of spirits, expressed . bimself.
                        as:being always delighted to receiveany foreigners who were really.
                        intereated : in, the. development of hiscountry. He-said that-he was
                        thoroughly satisfied with the progress Egypt was. making, and was convinced;
                        thati he and his . advisers were treading the right- path, bat that much yet
                        remained to be done.</p>

                    <p>With regard to the: finencial: situation,: the Khedive said. he was,
                        delighted: at the good sense. his. people. had shown. in.not., specujating
                        during: the recent.boom.. Thay: were-dependent on, their agricultural
                        labour, and, as. long: as their chief produce. was cotton, and the present
                        price was maintained, the prosperity of the country must increase, a8 the,
                        area ander cul- tivation was eye widening</p>

                    <p>He remarked: on, the Aiteceoce 3 in the appear- ance.of the suburb Abbassia
                        now and its appear- ance when hecame to. the.throne fifteen years ago; then
                        it wasall-gardens and. waste land, now it was covered by villas, blocks of
                        flats, and sbops, all of which represented solid wealth. His Highness was
                        very.emphatic in. expressing his delight . at. having. Six Eldon Gorst once
                        more in Egypt. Sir. Eldon, he. said had. been in hifi service both
                        as.adviser to. the: Minister of the Interior, .and. adviser to the.
                        Minister: of Finance; and was'therefore thoroughly aequaint- ed with the
                        administrative machinery. of the country. He remarked on the sympathetic and
                        enlightened interest which. Sir Eldon Gorst took in the country,
                        particularly drawing atten- tion to his late journey through Lower Egypt,
                        and his visit to. Upper Egypt and. the Soudan.</p>

                    <p>His. Highness went on to say that he was very proud of the progress the
                        Egyptian was. making,in education, and that he was certain there were
                        no.people who were more quick at learning. Egypt never. lacked able men. He
                        dwelt on the services that Nubar Pasba,, Riaz Pasha, and Mustapha Pasha
                        Fehmi had render- ed their country, and the way all the seriously- minded
                        Egyptians emphasised the common end they had in view by rallying round his
                        Highness on all public ocyasions. He deeply deplored the tendency shown by a
                        few of the yoanger Egyp- tians to seek self-advertisement rather than the
                        improvement of their country by legitimate means. He was, however,
                        delighted. that all agitation was dying-out. His Highness remark- ed that
                        the Egyptian had so charming a cha- racter that all agitations soon came to
                        a natural end. He emphasised the entire absence of fana ticism, but said
                        that all people should respect the religious prejudices of others.</p>

                    <p>With regard to the Soudan, the Khedive said that it was an entirely different
                        country and could not be governed by the same methods as as Egypt ; he had
                        every confidence in the Sir- dar and his staff, and was delighted at the
                        very material progress made daoring the last few years. His Highness
                        regarded with great grati- fication the real material ‘and moral improve-
                        ment in the condition of the people he loved so well, which had been
                        achieved in the fifteen years-of his reign.</p>

                    <p>Abbas Hilmi then went on to discuss politi- cal events in England, in which
                        he takes the very keenest interest, particularly in the Socia- lists’
                        campaign On terminating the audience the Khedive said how delighted he was
                        at Lord Cromer’s reeovery, and he hoped that one win- ter he might re-visit
                        Egypt.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="bold">A PIGMY BROUGHT TO EGYPT.</hi></p>

                    <p>About the year 2500 B.C. a prince of Elephantime named Herkhuf made up his
                        mind to penetrate farther towards the mysté- rions lands -of the south. It
                        is forty-four centu- ries sincé he set out over the desert, with the wind
                        whistling past his ears and the powerful sun warming his bone and his heart
                        within him; yet the story of his adventures may still be read, the path by
                        which he travelled may atill be discerned, and the names of his captains may
                        still be seen on the rocks of the land of Arthet. Herkhof, having obtained
                        the necessary order from the Pharaon, set out with his father Ara, “in
                        order,” ashe says, “to explore a road to the country of Aam.” The.road which
                        he explored and opened up was. probably a continuation of the route from
                        Elephantine to Arthet, passing not far back from the river, and descending
                        to the water between Abu Simbel and Wady Halfa in the heart of the land of
                        Aam. The expedition was entirely successful, and Herkhuf states that he was
                        “very. greatly. praised. for it.” Emboldened by the fame which his
                        enterprise had brought him, be made a second expedition. to Aam, and
                        was.gone from Egypt eight months. A third excusion was more adventurous.
                        Herkhuf set out upon the “Oasis Road,” which runs from a point north ofAswan
                        to Kurkur Oasis, and thence. branches to Tomas or Arthet and to the Oasis of
                        Khargeh which lies westward, and which in those days was inhabited by |
                        Libyan tribes. At the Kurkur junction Har- khuf met with an army under the
                        leadership of the Prince of Aam, which was on its way to chastise these
                        Libyans ; but how the wily Egyptians contrived to use it instead asan escort
                        to his own men. back to Aam, and how he returned to Egypt through the
                        hostile territory of Sethu, Arthet, and Wawat, with three hundred asses
                        laden with the presents of his host, are tales too long to narrate here.</p>

                    <p>One story only may be recorded in this ar- ticle. During a fourth expedition
                        to Aam, Herkhuf had managed to obtain one of the dwarfs or pigmies who
                        inhabited a regiou of the Land of the Ghosts. He at once informed the king,
                        now the boy Pepy II ; and in reply he received the following letter,-which
                        is, per- haps, the earliest example in the world’s history of a private
                        communication :—</p>

                    <p>“T have noted,” writes the King, “the mat- ter of your letter which you have
                        sent me, in order that I might know that you have re- turned in safety from
                        Aam, with the army which was with you. . . . You say in your let- ter that
                        you have brought a dancing pigmy of the god from the Land of the Ghosts,
                        like the pigmy which the Treasurer Baurded brought from the Land of Pount in
                        the time of Asesa You say to my majesty, ‘Never before has one like him béen
                        brought by any one who has visited Aam.’ . . Come northward, .therefere, to
                        the court immediately, and bring this pigmy with you, which you must bring
                        living, pros perous, and healthy, from the Land of the Ghosts, to dance for
                        the king and to rejoice and gladden the heart of the king. ... My majesty
                        desires to see this pigmy more than the gifts of Sinai and of Pount. If you
                        arrive at court, the pigmy being with you, alive, prosperous, and healthy,
                        my majesty will do for yon a greater thing than that which was done for the
                        Treasurer Baurded in the time ot Asesa, according to the heart’s desire of
                        my majesty to see this pigmy. Orders have been sent to the chief of the New

                    <p>These two volumes, the first; by H. Saladin, devoted to architecture, the
                        second, by Gaston Migeon, to the plastic and indastrial arts, form a
                        complete survey’ of Mahomedan art ! They are very fully illustrated, for the
                        most part:from photographs, well reproduced Some- times one could wish to
                        see the architectaral views on.a.somewhat larger scale: The detail would
                        have gained ; even the plans, which are numerous and most valuable, are
                        occasionally marred by over-reduction, making the lettering an irritation:to
                        decipher. But, on the whole, the illustration is excellent in quality, as
                        well as abandant, though the historical portions would. have. benefited by
                        maps—not many ordinary readers can “place” with surety such sites as Diafoul
                        or Veramine. One is grateful for the bibliographical lists, which are full ;
                        and for the indexing, so far as it goes ; buta separate index.of
                        illustrations would have been a-beon. Sometimes, too, though beth

                        when, in the account (in Vol I.) of the building known as the Mosque of

                        the mosaic frieze, which is one of the glories of the. dome. But.these, are

                        <p>London, January 3.</p>

                        <p>It is a good omen so far as the money mar- ket’is concerned that the year
                            has opened with very bright prospects. The outlook: for the fa- ture
                            seems brighter than for 4 long time past, and the stérm clouds are now
                            rapidly disper- sing. The last two months have been anxious ones to the
                            Bank of England, and have caused no little inconvenience to the
                            financial comma- nity generally, but the reduction of the Bank rate to 6
                            percent. which was made yesterday, may be accepted as indicating that
                            the chances _ of further trouble are remote.</p>

                        <p>Among some of the most conservative bank- ers the step taken by the Bank
                            yesterday caus- ed a little surprise, as it was felt that the di-
                            rectors, following up their well-justified policy of caution, might
                            probably wait a week or two longer to see what developments the torn of
                            the; year might bring. For the most part, however: the reduction was
                            fully expected. This week’s: Bank return appears to justify the line
                            taken. The reserve has further risen one-and-three quarter millions,
                            bringing the total up to near- ly twentyone and a half millions. The
                            situation: in America is also considerably improved, and there is little

                            Moreover, it is probable:that gold will shortly be returning from Egypt,
                            and the next few weeks should al- so see the return of a proportion of
                            the’precious metal sent to the States.</p>

                        <p>The Bank return shows that the stock of coin and bullion is up
                            £1,79%,000, all of which, with the exception of about half a million,
                            came back from the provinces. The net addition to the reserve is
                            £1,792,000, bringing the total to £21,473,'.00, which com- pares with
                            £19,689,000 a year ago. The pro- portion to liabilities has declined 44
                            per cent., to 35% percent. In the corresponding week of 1907 the
                            proportion was 334 per cent The reduction in the Bank rate has brought
                            about an appreciable decline in discount rates, and the rate for three
                            months’ bills is now about 4455.</p>

                        <p>The pressure incidental to the end of the year and the Consols
                            “carry-over” caused an extensive demand for short loans at the begin-
                            ning of the week, and the Bank did a very large business at 7} per
                            cent., whilst in the outside market as much as 8 per cent. was paid on
                            Tuesday.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday there was again a good demand for short loans in connection
                            with repayments to the Bank at 44 to 4} per cent., and weekly

                        <p>As if to atone tor.the laxity displayed during the year, the stock
                            markets signalised the close of 1907 with a burst of activity in all de-
                            partments, and prices showed a rapid advance. Subsequent events seem to
                            indicate, however, that the business transacted was largely ofa
                            professional order, and was carried through with the idea of bringing in
                            the support of the public. The move does not appear to have been
                            successful,and investors have not respond- ed with the heartiness which
                            is usually lgoked for atthe New Year. Of course the present week has not
                            been a good one for business. The closing of the “house” on Wednesday
                            was a disturbing influence, and the bright, sharp weather, seems to have
                            induced many people to prolong their holidays fora few days.</p>

                        <p>The outlook forthe New Year is anything bot unsatisfactory. There is good
                            promise of much easier money conditions, which should | cause capital
                            which has ‘been let out at dis- count to be invested in stocks and
                            shares, and thére are also signs that one or two trades which have
                            absorbed a large amount of money during the past two or three years
                            are.nearing the end of the boom. The Lancashire cotton trade
                            is-anexample. Although the spinners are stil doing well, the owners of
                            weaving mills are finding difficulty in obtaining orders, and
                            “short-time” has become general in sever- al districts. All this should
                            help the market for stocks and shares.</p>

                        <p>The prospects for Egyptians are good, and things look like going ‘better.
                            It is probable that the banks will again extend credit on the | best
                            securities when the financing of the cotton is completed.</p>

                        <p>M. Joagph Jouillat, who livesat-85;Rue du Perrey, Havre, istam~excellent
                            energetic working mason. His health, at’ one “time precarious, has been
                            completely re-estab- lished, thanks to the treatment of Dr. Will- |

                            of his fellow-workmen.</p>

                        <p>"For six months,” writes M. Jonillat, “my health left a lot to be
                            desired. 1. was -very mach troubled.in my work on account-of~my
                            sufferings and-my growing weakness. I suffered through acute stomach
                            trouble, and. I .weak- ened because my impaired organa failedxto nourish
                            me sufficiently and to recompenseme for the loss of strength which-each
                            day’s work entailed. I was, therefore, always indis- posed. I was often
                            seized with giddiness, which for a mason working. or a scaffold, is
                            naturally a very serious complaint. I also.had persistent sick headaches
                            and neuralgia. At night» slept very badly and got. scarcely any. rest.
                            In spite of all the medicines which I was made | to take,my stomach
                            troubles remained uncured. Happily, however, I was at last advised to
                            take Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, and these havedone me
                            agreat deal of ‘good. | From the first box.I obtained a much improved:
                            appetite, and digested my food considerably better. I quickly regained:
                            my-strength, and | my. complete cure was very rapid.”</p>

                        <p>Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.are an excellent | remedy for overworked
                            .stomachs—stomachs too weak to: digest food, and, therefore-:in=
                            sufficiently nourishing. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills’ for Pale People
                            impart to the stomach, the. force which it lacks, because they enrich
                            impoverished blood,-and; because: the zich blood which they cause
                            tefreely circulate in the veins carries to all the organs including-the
                            stomach, the strength which has to be replaced. Thay are also a cure for
                            anemia, chlorosis, sick headaches, neuralgia, general weakness, and

                    <p>La Cour d’Appel Mixte vient dese pronon- cer sur une trés intéressante
                        question de prin- cipe en matiére decomptes-oourants en banque. ‘Tl
                        sagissait desavoir si un établissement de crédit ou tout autre créancier
                        gagiste avait, le droit de faire vendre le gage dra que la marge devenait
                        insuffisante 4 lui garantir son avance. Ce qui ajoutait de Vintérét a cette
                        question cest bien natorellement la situation générale de la bourse des
                        valeurs et surtout une ordon- nance rendue récemment par le tribonal dans
                        une affaire analogue od le premier juge avait déclaré que le créancier
                        gagiste n’avait pas le droit de faire vendre aux enchéres, parce que, la
                        vente ne pouvant etre motivée que par Un danger réel, il ne croyait pas que
                        les prix pus- sent baisser encore. Depuis lors, les faits, ¢’est- 4-dire la
                        baisse des cours, sont venus démentir cette assertion.</p>

                    <p>En Vespéce il s’agit d'un employé des Douanes Egyptiennes, M. J. ‘Abaouat,
                        sujet local demeurant a Alexandrie, qui s’était fait ouvrir un
                        compte-courant au Crédit Lyon- nais et dont la marge devenue insuffisante
                        avait obligée la banque 4A appliquer ses régle- ments.</p>

                    <p>En premiere instance le juge avait fixé pour la vente un délai au risque,
                        ainsi quecela semble sétre vérifié en l’espece, de voir diminuer la valeur
                        du gage et empirer par suite la situation du débiteur. C'est contre ce
                        premier jugement que le.Crédit Lyonnais avait fait appel.</p>

                    <p>Contrairement 4 l'exception soulevée par J. Abaouat, la Coura retena que le
                        non-commer- gant qui se fait ouvrir un compte-courant dans les conditions
                        ordinaires de la place,est réputé, du moins a priori, avoir fait acte de
                        commerce, A défaut de toute convention contraire. Sur cela il ne peut y
                        avoir de doute.</p>

                    <p>Tout Vintérét du débat se résume dans les modes de preave du contrat et du
                        maximum des intéréts de réaliaation du gage, ainsi que dans la compétence.
                        da tribunal appelé a con- naitre des. contestations relatives au solde du
                        compte. A ce point de vue, celui qui sans autre spécification se fait ouvrir
                        uu compte courant nanti d’un gage est suppoad s’étre soumis par le fait
                        m@éme 4 des conditions &amp; défaut des- quelles il n’aurait pu obtenir
                        aucune.avance.</p>

                    <p>Sur la question de délai, la Cour, a déclaré Vappel recevable, infirmé le
                        jugement attaqueé et décidé que la vente dont s'agit se ferait dans les
                        trois jours qui suivront l’apposition des affiches et la date des
                        insertions. J. Abaouat a été de plus condamné aux dépens des deux
                        degrés.</p>

                    <p>Avec un marché aussi restreint que celui que nous avons depuis quelque temps
                        il est bien difficile de parler de tendance. Tout ce qu'on peut dire c’est
                        que pour le moment les ache- teurs continuent &amp; s’abstenir, soit dans
                        |’attente | de\cours plus avantageux ou peu confiants en- core dans une
                        reprisé prochaine. Avec la série de baisses que nous gnregistrons depuis des
                        mois | on ne peut qu’aprouver cette réserve. Dans peu de temps d’ailleurs on
                        sera fixé sur la possibilité d’un relévement pour le printemps. Si un revi-
                        rement haussier ne se produit pas &amp; bref délai, beaucoup de positions
                        irrégulitres devront étre liquidées.</p>
