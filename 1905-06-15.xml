                        that a Japanese girl had been rescued from the hands of those who would have
                        wrought her rain. This girl, an intelligent and apparently innocent young
                        woman of 16, is now at the Rudolph Home. There being no Japanese Consul in
                        Alexandria, the British Consn 1-Goneral, Mr. K B. Gould, I.S.U., has takon
                        tho matter in hand, and has oom municated with the British representative in
                        Japan with a view to the girl’s restoration her own oountry. We understand
                        that measures have been taken by the recently appointed executive committee
                        of the repression society for the effective supervision of all incoming
                        ships, and it is to be hoped that by this means a stop will be put to a

                    concessions the Government insists on a share in the profits, often oven a half
                    share. Another point is that these two gentlemen have obtained a concession for
                    70 years, while in the casos of English oompanies’ oonoessions (such, for
                    example, as the Egyptian Markets, the Helouan Railway Company, and others), the
                    concession is for a much more limited period, less than half of the time given
                    to the Abbassieh Oasis concessionaires.</p>
                <p>A Cairo correspondent writes :—“The above remarkable transaction is causing more
                    than an uproar in Cairo, in view especially of the fret that only a few months
                    back an official notioe issued by the Government stated emphatically that no big
                    areas of land would be disposed of in future. Directly opposed to this, however,
                    fifteen thousand feddans, i.e., sixty-threi million square metres of land,
                    eminently snitable for building purposes, in the immediate vicinity to the
                    north-west of the largest oity in Africa, is sold for L.K 15,000—ajbig deal and
                    certainly the finest bargain from thepurohasers’ point of view ever reoorded
                    here. The concession for quick elec trio communication with the city granted at
                    the same time to the two private buyers, a native Pasha and a Belgian gentleman
                    connected with the Cairo trams, will bring this projected suburb within twenty
                    minutes of Opera-square. For years it has been known that the gentlemen at the
                    head of the Cairo trams could get anything from tho Government for the mere
                    trouble of asking, bat the present transaction really beats anything on record.
                    .“It will be plain to everyone that the principal losers are first and foremost
                    the Egyptian Government, who could have asked and obtained with ease a sum of at
                    least one million sterling for the land in question. The second to lose by the
                    transaction is very obviously the Delta Light Railway, who have just taken over
                    at a heavy cost the Helouan line in spite of the opposition of the Cairo trams.
                    One can read between the lines, however, and sec that the latter have now
                    attained something towards taking from the English oompany the laurels so dearly

                <p>THE COTTON MARKET</p>

                <p>Kearsley and Cunnikoham’s Weekly Report. Liverpool, June 8. In Egyptian Cotton
                    only a moderate business has been done, and quotations are generally reduced ^
                    d. @ £ d. per lb.</p>

                <p>Egyptian Futures bare been idle all the week and prioes show a decline of 18
                    points for Jane and 15 points fur other positions. The following are the latest
                    quotations, vis:— Jane 6.40 Aug. 6.42 Oot 6.37 July 6.44 8ep. 6.89 Nov. 6.34
                    Deo. 6.30</p>

                <p>American Futures.—The market this week has been decidedly lees active and prioes
                    have experienced a sharp decline, amounting to 15 @17 points from those of last
                    Thursday. Near months have been pressed for sale and show tho largest deoline.
                    The sharp fall in prioes is chiefly due to improved weather reports and to the
                    Bureau report being better than expected, both as regards the decrease in
                    hcreage and also in the estimated condition of the crop. Should the weather
                    remain favorable throughout the month of June, we should expect the Crop to
                    recover much of its present lateness and also to make good muoh of the reoent
                    unfavorable condition. The price of 4id. per lb., seems for the moment to faifly
                    represent/the situation, and the only (pinion we can form, in a market whioh is
                    so dependent upon daily Crop reports, is that we are not likefcjo have any
                    important movement in .prices bnt may expect frequent fluctuations. The latest
                    quotations are Delivery.— June 4.48 Sep./Oot 4.48 Jan./Peb. 4.50 June/July 4.48
