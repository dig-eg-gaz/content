                    <p> General State of the Cairo monuments now leaves little to be desired in
                        point of preservation, so far as the preservation of such peculiar Parish of
                        old buildings as possible, and the chief interest of the present report lies
                        in its record of restoration. We are always anxious when we read of
                        restoration but we are bound to say that the indefatigable Chief Architect
                        of the Cairo Commission, Herz Bey, whose hand and brain are prominent and
                        every page of the report do as much to allay our fears. In his earliest
                        attempts he was perhaps inclined to be rash, and the results were sometimes
                        crude; but he has learned much by long experience and patient study and will
                        naturally eager, as a true architect to carry into perfect realization his
                        ideas of what Saracenic art really was in its integrity, he is scrupulous
                        and adhering strictly and faithfully to the minutest details of the original
                        designs. We know it was satisfaction that the condition upon which doctor
                        Stanley Lane Poole especially insisted in his report to Lord Cromer on the
                        preservation of the monument 10 years ago - namely, that every scrap of new
                        work added to an historical monument must be authenticated by an inscription
                        given the date of such addition- has been carefully observed. This is not
                        only essential in the interest of historical honesty, but as her they
                        observes, is also in keeping with the custom of the Mamluk restorers
                        themselves though their motive was rather self-glorification than scientific
                        authentication of the data of architectural history. The chief work of
                        restoration at present in hand is that of the famous mosque of Sultan
                        Hassan, on which Herz Bey has published an elaborate monograph. The details
                        of this comprehensive restoration seem to have excited some criticism,
                        especially on the part of that very competent authority Artin Pasha; But we
                        must wait for fuller reports before dealing with this question. So far as we
                        have ourselves observed his work, Herz Bey There is no pains to get it the
                        exact original materials, designs, and colors, before introducing any modern
                        reproductions; but it is manifestly impossible to reproduce the softones of
                        age in New work. The principal Restoration lately completed is that of the
                        fine colonnaded Mosque of el-Maridani, a famous Mamluk emir of the
                        fourteenth century, who was Saqi, or cupbearer to the Sultan-en-Nasir b.
                        Qalaun, to whose reign many of the finest Saracenic monuments belong. Those
                        who saw this great ruin in the 90s probably regarded it as a hopeless Wreck.
                        The Columns and roofs were short up with endless scaffold poles; stucco work
                        was crumbling on the ground, the inlaid mosaics were almost
                        indistinguishable; and the whole was a mass of dirt and dust. Yet for those
                        who understood there was enough of the original work left to make
                        restoration of bare possibility, and such treatment of a large Mosque of the
                        congregational colonnaded type was eminently Desirable in order to show this
                        type in its Perfection. Heather to most of the Restorations at Cairo had
                        been restricted to the smaller to most of the transept and other types. The
                        work upon L maradani was begun in 1897, and the mosque was at last we open
                        for public prayer and April, 1907. It was certainly a Triumph of
                        architectural scale. Walls, columns, roofs, utterly decayed and tottering,
                        had to be taken down; but all the columns and stones that could be used
                        again were numbered and correspondence with the detailed plan of the mosque,
                        and set up again and their own place. Traces of conical green tile work were
                        found on some of the crenellations - reminding one of the mosque of el-Nasir
                        in the Citadel- this fact was not lost sight of in the restoration. Without
                        any attempt to restore the whole building to its original state of
                        decoration, which would have been a costly process, and might have a vote
                        criticism on the score of gaudiness, the plan was adopted of restoring
                        completely samples of each class, e.g. the painted ceilings , the Gilded
                        Corinthian capitals, are represented by only a few specimens in the original
                        colors, so far as they can be reproduced. the main object was the
                        preservation of the building and its entirety not the reproduction of all
                        the decorative details and the distinction was wise. The mosaics in the
                        Mihrab, or prayer-niche, however, have been fully reproduced. Some of the
                        original carved panels of the pulpit where fortunately recovered from
                        Europe, but no attempt was made to supply the place of the missing panels by
                        modern carving. The Dome over the niche presented a difficulty, since it had
                        disappeared for centuries; but a new dawn was finally constructed. The
                        ablution tank was brought from the mosque of Sultan Hassan- a step which has
                        provoked critical comment, but which was perhaps justifiable, since it did
                        not belong to the original constructions of that mosque. Herz Bey devotes an
                        interesting appendix in the present report to an account of the history of
                        el-Maridani’s foundation and its restoration, and Prince of all the
                        inscriptions, both medieval and modern, illustrating his remarks by 7:30
                        graphs representing the Moss before and after restoration. We are very glad
                        to notice that, following the recommendations already referred to in Lord
                        Cromer's report, no restorations are be gone until complete plan and
                        photographs have been made of each monument in its untouched state. The
                        commission is to be warmly congratulated on its scrupulous care of the
                        beautiful monuments placed under its charge. </p>

                    <p> Commenting upon the movement to bark . the gratitude of Great Britain for
                        Lord Cromer’s work, the “Spectator” says :— “We note with great satisfaction
                        that a moyement is on foot to bestow some special mark of the national
                        gratitude on Lord Cromer and that it is suggested that this should take the
                        form of a money grant. We very much hope that the Government will propose
                        such a grant_to the House of Commons, and that Lord Cromer will not veto the
                        scheme. It is no secret that Lord Cromer is anything but a rich man, and,
                        though he never encouraged undue lavishness or extravagance in the style of
                        living adopted ‘at the British Agency, his official salary only just enabled
                        him to keep.up the large establishment required by his official position,
                        and to meet the great calls made upon the purse.of one who was not only the
                        actual ruler‘of Egypt, but also the head of the British coleny in Cairo,
                        Lord Cromer’s friends haye felt.for many years that his salary ought at
                        least to have been as large as that of the Governor of Madras (£8,000) or
                        the. -Ambas- sador in Paris (£10,000). . Yet, as a matter of fact, it was
                        only £6,500, and this though Cairo is an exceedingly expensive place in
                        which to live according to the European stan- dard. Lord Cromer’s feelings

                    <head> THEATRE ZIZINIA.</head>
                    <p>On Saturday: evening Monsieur Stephanos Christaki, the teacher of eloention
                        and drama- tic recitation, took part in a gala performance organised by his
                        namerous pupils, on the occa- sion of his impending departure. For the first
                        and most important part of the programme, Jean Richepin’s “Je Flibustier”
                        was chosen and proved a very acceptable item. ‘The fine verses of the well
                        known French playright were very intelligently given ont by Mr. Christaki in
                        the title role of Francois Legoés, and although oceasionally his intonation
                        was slighty irregu- lar,- his words were always clear. His perform- ance
                        right through was very creditable and his @fforts fully deserved the
                        applause which aredted him at the end of the second‘act. The other
                        characters were satisfactorily handled by M.M. Hornbostel, Mors, Nicolas and
                        Kremer land Mmes. Nicolas and Beraldi ; all proved themselves conscientious
                        pupils and if, at times, their delivery was a little amateurish, their
                        elocution was always correct and distinct. The evening closed with “15
                        Heures de Fiacre!” a two act comedy by Clairville and Nuitter aid in this,
                        Mr Christaki brought peals of langhter from his andience. Although the piece
                        in itself does not call for any special remark, the artists of the evening
                        to whom were added M.M. Paal, Levy, Piron, Autofage and Blanc, did
                        their-very best and succeeded Army of Occupation, medical men, managers.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday afternoon at five o'clock the foundation stone of the preparatory
                        school for Greek children, to be built by the generosity of Mr. George
                        Zervudachi, was laid in the presence of a large gathering of the members of
                        the Alexandrian Greek community. Nearly five thousand persons were present
                        at the ceremony which was most brilliant and impos- ing ; among them we
                        noticed Hafiz Bey, Sub- Governor of Alexandria, Mr Gould, H.B.M’s, Consul,
                        Mr. Scotidis, Hellenta, Consol Gamanal, Dr, Schiess Pasha, Mr. Chataway, Mr

                        girls schools with teaching staff and pupils. The religious ceremony was
                        conducted by his Beatitude, Mgr. Photios, Patriarch of the Greek Orthodox
                        Church, who was accom- panied by the Bishop of Tripoli, Mgr. Teofanis
                        Mosconas, and the clergy of the Greek Churches. After the ceremony was
                        concluded and the blessing had been delivered, the official document was
                        signed by the authorities and the leading members of the colony, and the
                        stone was laid by Mr. George Zervudachi assisted by Master Constantine and
                        Miss Kitty Zervudachi and the elder pupils of the gymna- sium. </p>
                    <p>Several speeches were delivered, the first speaker being Mr. Benachi,
                        president of the community, who thanked Mr. Zervadachi in their name. Mr.
                        Zervudachi in reply expressed his desire to do his utmost to further the
                        education of his compatriots and instill in them the principles of humanity.
                        Speeches were also given by Mr. Scotidis and Mgr. Photios and at half past
                        five the assembly broke up. During the ceremony the music was supplied by
                        the boys school band and the Greek philharmonic band.</p>

                    <p>Larnaca, April 19. The election petition proceedings are approaching the end
                        and it is expected that judgment will be given case within the next few
                        days. Meanwhile the Legislative Council has been getting through its pro-
                        gramme and during the past week has been concerned witha private Bill
                        relating to the election of an Archbishop, which is, here,an ever-burning
                        question. The Bill, we under- tand, has now reached the Committee stage ;
                        how much further it will go remains to be seen. 
                        Artesian Wells. The Artesian
                        well-boring operations, which were commenced near the chief secretariat
                        buildings some two years or more ago have now ceased, and the plant has
                        lately been removed to another spot. The boring which had been carried to a
                        depth of about 800 feet had to be abandoned owing to the rocky nature of the
                        soil which was met with, render- ing further operations impracticable. It is
                        to be hoped that better results will be attained from the new borings now to
                        be commenced, as success in obtaining water by this means should prove a
                        turning point in the general agriculture of the country.
                        For the S.P.C.A. On
                        the 29th instant a fancy dress ball was given in the theatre, Nicosia, in
                        aid of the branch of the S.P.C.A. Owing to the date ing during the Greek
                        Lent very few of the Greek conmmunity were present, which, from the
                        Society’s point of view, must have been regrettable and must have caused a
                        diminution in the anticipated receipts. The evening, however, passed off
                        very well and the dresses were gay and for the most part picturesque and
                        effective. The gentlemen’s prize went to a "Golliwog,” while the ladies
                        prize was politely awarded to the honorary secretary of the soci- ety. Other
                        dresses worthy of notice were: Be- rengaria, two ladies of the Court of
                        Louis XIV., Queen Elizabeth, a Norwegian peasant, and an early Victorian
                        young lady ; while among the gentlemen’s were Richard, Coeur de Lion, a
                        North American Indian, Sir Walter Raleigh, Black and White, and the
                        Education Bill. The theatre had been tastefully decorated for the occasion,
                        and an excellent effect was produced by shading the strong central Lux light
                        with coloured gauze, lengths of which were made to radiate from it and
                        carried to the various boxes of the first tier. The Zaptieh band pro- vided
                        the music.
                        Amateur Dramatic Society. An Amateur Dramatic Society has just
                        been formed among the English com- munity, with its headquarters in Nicosia.
                        Its first private performance was held on the 9th instant at the house of Lt
                        Col. and Mrs. Gore, kindly lent by them for the occasion. The programme was
                        varied and consisted of singing, tableaux, incidental music and two
                        diologues; The net proceeds go to a charity fund, specially formed by the
                        society, Admission was by invitation only, but we hear that the
                        entertainment was mich appreciated by those who were present. The society
                        should be a welcome addition to the English social life at the metropolis,
                        and prove the means of developing and displaying a fair amount of local
                        talent. 
                        Cricket Match. On Saturday the 12th instant a cricket match was
                        played at Nicosia, Nicosia C.Club v. The Island. Although the latter
                        included some very fair players and were regarded as a strong eleven they
                        suffered a disastrous defeat, for the home team declared their innings at
                        293 for eight wickets and succeeded in despatching their opponents for the
                        Gi gl of 27. The latter then followed on, with scarcely better results and
                        were all out in their second- innings for 57. A return match will doubtless
                        be arranged when we hope to witness a change of fortune. Feeding of Animals.
                        This spring has been one of plenty in the matter of green fodder, and cattle
                        of all kinds have been able to get more than their usual allowance of
                        succulent food. Owing to many rainy days, the green barley has not matured
                        as rapidly as is generally the case and the animals have therefore enjoyed a

                    <p>A few friends of the late Colonel Frank Rho- des, C.B,D.S.0., of the 1st.
                        Royal Dragoons, have recently placed on thenorth wall ofDalham Church, near
                        Newmarket, a memorial tablet to this gallant officer, whose distinguished
                        career was cut short by death at the Appa in September, 1907. The tablet
                        records the many campaigns in the Sudan and Africa, in which the deceased
                        took part, including the actions of El Teb, Tamai, Abu-klea, Tamai, the
                        Atbara, and Omdurman, where he was severely wounded. It also mentions that
                        he acted as Chief of Staff to General Sir Gerald Portal on his his mission
                        to Uganda, and took part in the siege of Ladysmith, and the relief of
                        Mafeking. The character of the late officer is well-express- ed in the
                        following eulogy with which the tablet concludes: A gentleman who knew not
                        fear, a soldier, sportsman, prince of friends, a man men could but love lies

                        Antartic Regions.” Capt. Armitage (Lieut. R. N; R.) was one of the

                        of the hospital, which has proved itself invaluable to the port, that the

                        than that of Thurs- day. Under such conditions it is really a pleasure to be
                        present at the pleasant grounds of the Sporting Club, not a little adding to
                        the charm of the afternoon being the exquisite toilettes of some of the
                        ladies present. It is really difficult to specialise any particular race,
                        almost all being keenly fought contests, but perhaps the National Stakes,
                        the Grand Prize of Alexandria, and the Pony Handicap were the best. Although
                        only three went to the post for the first the excitement of the neck and
                        neck race between Princess and Gou- vernant resulting in a narrow victory
                        for Princess, compensated for the small field. The Grand Prize of Alexandria
                        brought out the largest field of the afternoon, resulting, after a [good
                        race, in a win for the outsider Au Revoir. The last race of the day the Pony
                        Handicap went to Frou Fron, fiields riding a brilliant race in overtaking
                        Fadgham. During the 5th race the Ramleh Scurry, Challoner the rider of Damon
                        was thrown, owing to Digby on <cb n="3"/> Khadouf drawing out from the
                        inside and cannoning Damon. We were pleased to learn that except for a
                        shaking Challoner was un- hurt. The Band of the 1st Battalion Royal Dublin
                        Fusiliers conducted by Bandmaster Fawcett added to the enjoyment of the
                        after- noon by a pleasant selection of music.</p>

                    <p>The fifth annual report of the working of the Khedivial Yacht Club was
                        presented to a general meeting to be held on March 26th 1906 which was
                        adjourned to April 2nd, 1906, when the accounts for 1905 were passed and the
                        committee and officers elected for the year. The total number of members is
                        now 215 being an increase of 6 on the previous year On referring to the
                        statement of accounts it will be noticed that the Alexandria Municipality
                        made a donation of LE 50, and they have moreover kindly promised to increase
                        it this year to L.E. 75. Donations for prizes were also kindly given by the
                        Sporting Club and A. Chitty Bey. The committee gratefully acknow-ledge the
                        kindness of these gentlemen. On the expenditare side of the balance sheet it
                        is clearly shown in what way the reyenue of the club has been spent ; there
                        being a balance in hand of LE. 279: 211m/m. A great many improvements have
                        been carried out this year, including a new staircase from the jetty up to
                        the club house, and further improvements are contemplated. The whole of the
                        roof of the club has been asphalted which has proved very effective,
                        inasmuch as during the heavy rains of the past winter not a single leak has
                        been found. The new boat-shed and slip have brought in a sum of over L.E. 45
                        ; some of the money lent by the committee to build this shed has been
                        refunded, and over L.E. 91 has been spent in still improving the foreshore,
                        although the sea this winter has again done a great deal of damage to the
                        same which will cost a fair sum to put back again in proper order ; this may
                        he expected for one or two years until the new filling in has properly
                        settled down. This is the first year that the club has not had recourse to
                        its committee for defraying various expenses such as those incurred: by
                        entertain- ments, special “at bemes” etc., the increase in the annual
                        subscriptions approved last yeer having enabled it to hold its own, although
                        through the most regretted death of H.H. Prince Mohamed Ibrahim, it has not
                        received his usual donation of £50. The buffet has <cb n="5"/> cleared
                        expensed, having made a profit of LE. 2 after all expenses are paid,
                        including the wages of special waiters on regatta days Under the heading of
                        new furniture ete., the repairs to furnitare have been very great, and this
                        will always be the case so long as it is exposed to the elements. during the
                        winter, It can only be avoided by building a store to put the chairs, etc.
                        in, as the present store is much too small. With reference to the sailing,
                        the number of regattas held during the year was 24, and the average number
                        of yachts sailing in each was 16. This is the highest nomber yet reached,
                        the maximum number on any one day having been 20 on Angust 29th. The club
                        has gone ahead in this respect by leaps and bounds, there being over 8%
                        sailing yachts owned by the club members on the books ; moreover there are
                        now 2 steam yachts which fly the club’s burgee: The “ Cuhona ” 500 tons of
                        our commodore His Highness Prince Aziz Pasha Hassan and “ El Metwakil” of
                        His. Highness Prince Mohamed Aly Pacha. Several members have built. new
                        yachts such as W.R. Grafton Bey’s “ Ram-Seas ” and Mr: Schaar’s “
                        Feu-Follet;” others have ob-tained new yachts from Europe, such as Mr. J.
                        Chini’s “ Ananké ” and Mr, T. McClure’s “ Banshee I1:” the latest arnval
                        from South- ampton, and we understand that several more are expected this
                        year. In the Club races a monthly prize was given for points scored, and a
                        small weekly prize for the first boat in every regatta in both classes.
                        Owing to the great number and ‘ variety of the Club's yachts it is proposed
                        this year to have three |: classes as follows :—I. rating, II. large class,
                        III. centre board and small class No I explains itself and will be entirely
