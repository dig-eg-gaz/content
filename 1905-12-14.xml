                            these ventures are now beginning to appear, and erstwhile we noted the
                            publication of the initial report of the Egyptian Delta Land and
                            Investment Company. Last week was issued the first report of the
                            Corporation of Western Egypt, a concern which was floated early this
                            year, and holds concessions entitling it, amongst other things, to take
                            up during the course of the next three decades some 600,000 feddans of
                            land (a feddan being roughly an acre) in the cases of Khargs, Dakhla,
                            Farafra and Baharia. The report covers the period to 30th September
                            last, and shows that the Corporation is in a very strong financial
                            position. Of its £500,000 capital about £250,000 has been subscribed and
                            £215,600 paid up, the final call of 5s. per share having been postponed
                            because the Directors already possess for the time being sufficient
                            money for working purposes. Although over £110,000 has been spent on
                            preliminary operations, plant, etc., £98,000 is still in hand, either in
                            the shape of cash or easily realised firstclass securities. The
                            particulars given in the report make a good showing as a return for the
                            expenditures so far incurred. Kharga and the other oases mentioned will
                            not be familiar names to the majority of people, and it will suffice to
                            say that they represent a territory of about £74,000 square miles,
                            inhabited by a population of about 30,000 : that they lie about 300
                            miles from Cairo, off the Nile valley, and that by a branch line now in
                            course of construction and joining the State Railways at Farshut, they
                            will be brought into direct communication with the capital. A detailed
                            survey of a considerable portion of Central Kharga has been made during
                            the past season, and the cultivable areas of some x00 square kilometrees
                            have been determined and mapped out. The whole of the railway route has
                            been surveyed, and, as already stated, the construction of the line has
                            commenced, and even the contracts have been placed for the rolling
                            stock. One of the most satisfactory results of the development work is
                            that which has determined the adequacy of the water supply, a point of
                            primary importance in a venture of this kind in such a country as Egypt.
                            Boring operations both on the Kharga and Dakhla oases have demonstrated
                            a full artesian supply, and have satisfied the corporation's local
                            manager and geological expert that the yield is practically
                            inexhaustible. That the supply must be of extraordinary permanence is
                            proved by the fact that old wells sunk by the Romans and ancient
                            Egyptians, when reopened, still pour out over 500 gallons a minute.</p>
                        <p>Given a good water supply for irrigation, the successful development of
                            the land is practically assured, other things being equal. This
                            development has naturally had a chief claim on the attention of the
                            Directors, and it is to promote it that communication is being
                            established as rapidly as possible with the State Railways. This
                            connection will not only assist in the exploitation of the oases, but
                            must necessarily thereby be a determining factor in the value of the
                            land. The worth of land is rising throughout Egypt generally, as Land
                            Cromer had occasion to point out in his last report ; and thought the
                            Directors have already had applications for claims they are waiting to
                            see what effect the completion of the first section of the railway will
                            have in increasing the value of their estates before striking an
                            approximate maximum price for purchasers. The Directors state that on
                            present data they think £20 per feddan ought to be obtained in the
                            neighborhood of the line and £10 per feddan in the more remote
                            districts. Taking an average of only £12 10s per feddan for the 20,000
                            feddans the corporation is entitled to exploit per annum, the gross
                            revenue from this source alone would be £250,000. The land is of loamy
                            clay, similar to that already cultivated and yielding excellent crops of
                            cereals, dates, etc. ; but the corporation's experts are making an
                            exhaustive study of the local conditions to determine whether cotton and
                            other staples can also be profitably grown. The land business, however,
                            great as it is, is by no means the only interest of the corporation. Its
                            concessions carry mineral and other rights, and their exploitation, it
                            is hoped, will contribute to the general success of the undertaking. At
                            present, for obvious reasons, attention to this side of the
                            corporation's prospects has been rather restricted in scope, but enough
                            has been accomplished to show that the mineral possibilities are far
                            from unpromising. An expert who has been examining the earthy minerals,
                            such as alum, ochres and salts of manganese and cobalt, states that,
                            pending a full analysis, he has no hesitation in asserting that their
                            potential value is commercially very great. Aluminous deposits of vast
                            extent have already been disclosed at Kharga, and are to be worked for
                            aluminium sulphate by a process of manufacture that can be undertaken by
                            the natives alone. These particulars serve to show the large sphere of
                            operations covered by the corporation, and if the rapid progress made
                            during the present year be maintained, there should be much additional
                            matter of interest for the shareholders in the next annual report.</p>

                    <head>GOLD IN EGYPT. THE RECENT IMPORTANT FINDS.</head>
                    <p>The recent discovery of gold in the western oases is of the first importance
                        not only to the interests of the Corporation of Western Egypt but to the
                        general development of the mining industry of the country. It affords a
                        first indication of the actual direction in which the gold has drifted that
                        must have been eroded from the eastern hills daring vast geological periods
                        before man appeared in the Nile Valley, and also of the probable manner of
                        its deposition.</p>
                    <p>So far as the immediate interests of the Corporation are concerned,2 dwts.
                        per ton may not seem, at first sight, to be very important; but it is to be
                        remembered that the gold is contained in pyrites which form generally more
                        than one-tenth of the phosphate rook. This rook must in any case be powdered
                        to be commercially useful, and when this is done the pyrites can be
                        separated with very little expense, while the richness and commercial value
                        of the phosphates are greatly enhanced by its removal.</p>
                    <p>The separated pyrites should then carry from half an ounce to an ounce per
                        ton. and will be valuable as a source of sulphur and sulphuric acid, in
                        addition to yielding this amount of gold. It will also be necessary to
                        enquire what has become of the gold that has weathered out of the extensive
                        phosphate outcrops since the oases were first formed or since their
                        formation commenced.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to say at present exactly where it may be found, but it is
                        at least permissible to hope that it is held within the oases area. Another
                        point to be considered is what indication this discovery may give to aid in
                        tracing and discovering the “deep leads” which very possibly exist between
                        the gold belts of the Eastern hills and the oases. The discovery of such
                        leads would give a new impulse to Egyptian mining, and might result in most
                        important developments.</p>

                        at Assouan Reservoir has been settled in favor of the following contractors

                    <p>The above works are the result of 8ir Benjamin Baker's visit last season.
                        Whenhe visited the work last winter, he recommended extensive protective
                        works on the talus downstream of the dam, where the severe action of the
                        water through he sluices had eroded even the sound granite. The P. W. D. had
                        recognised the necessity of these protective works and had already commenced
                        them, and had in 1901 completed the repairs of certain of the worst places,
                        and were intending to spend a further sum of L.E 50,000 in 1905. Sir
                        Benjamin, however, recommended protective works upon a still larger scale
                        than this, which will involve an expenditure of something like a quarter of
                        a million of money, and take two years to complete.</p>

                    <head>EXPEDITION FOR STUDYING THE NILE CATARACTS.</head>
                    <p>It has been decided to make a complete and detailed survey of the Nile
                        cataracts, south of Wady-Halfa, and to study the possibility of constructing
                        another dam and reservoir , somewhere to the south of the existing one. Such
                        a supplementary work will probably be necessary, under any circumstances,
                        even should the Assouan dam be raised, as the future wants of Egypt will
                        necessitate a very large amount of water being stored, In any work of the
                        kind, constructed south of Wady-Halfa, a navigation channel and looks may be
                        omitted, as, with the railway from Wady-Halfa to Khartoum, no through river
                        traffic is likely to arise, more especially as, on this reach of the river,
                        it must always be difficult and dangerous, and only possible during
                        flood.</p>

                    <head>CAMPING OUT IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>There is some probability of the neighbourhood of the Ghizeh pyramids
                        becoming a favorite site for a residential European tent dwelling colony.
                        The Public Security Department of the Ministry of the Interior has
                        determined that these squatters should not be permitted to pitch their tents
                        there just as they please, and a notice has been issued wherein it is stated
                        that it is forbidden to erect tents in the vicinity of the Ghizeh pyramids
                        without a permit from the Ministry of tbs Interior.</p>
                    <p>Applications for such permits most be addressed to the Minister of the

                    <p>This regulation is also to apply to the erection of tents in the

                    <head>QUIET AT ALEXANDRIA. ACTION OF AUTHORITIES.</head>
                    <p>Yesterday no incident occurred at Alexandria to disturb public security, but
                        the state of mind of a large portion of the European population is by no
                        means tranquil. As an example of this feeling of insecurity we may instance
                        the run on the shops of the gunsmiths yesterday. The police authorities
                        thought that yesterday the panic had to all appearances so much subsided
                        that it would be permissible to allow the gunsmiths' establishments to be
                        reopened. But as soon as the decision of the authorities became known, there
                        was a great rush to buy arms on the part of Europeans and a big trade was
                        done in revolvers end other weapons. The authorities decided therefore to
                        again order the closing of these shops, and this morning all of the
                        gunsmiths were shut up and will remain so until further notice.</p>
                    <p>The police authorities ere quite satisfied that the attitude of the natives
                        is peaceful, and they are in fact quite cowed. But the authorities state
                        that they are afraid of the Europeans in their present excited state, and
                        believe that if there is any renewal of the disturbance it will be provoked
                        by the Europeans.</p>
                    <p>Morice Bey, Inspector of the Parquet at the Ministry of Justice, has arrived
                        from Cairo in connection with the forthcoming trials of the persons accused
                        of having taken part in the riot on Sunday afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Up to now no death has occurred among the Europeans and natives injured in
                        the disorders. Mr. Marsden, the sub-manager of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank, is
                        recovering from his wound, and will in all probability be able to resume his
                        duties next week.</p>
                    <p>CONVOCATION OF SHEIKHS.</p>
                    <p>This morning and yesterday afternoon there were two important meetings of all
                        the religious sheikha, who are accustomed to preach in the mosques at
                        Alexandria. These meetings were convened by the order of Mahmoud Pasha
                        8idky, Governor of Alexandria, and all who were summoned attended. The
                        Governor addressed the sheikhs on the subject of the recent disturbance and
                        laid strict injunctions upon them all to use their best endeavours in their
                        religious addresses to impress upon their hearers the need for calmness, as
                        unless the populace preserved its self-control public security would again
                        be disturbed. His Excellency's earnest exhortations had a great effect on
                        his audience and all the sheikhs present this morning and at yesterday's
                        meeting promised the Governor that they would be untiring in their efforts
                        to use their religious influence in the interests of public
                        tranquillity.</p>

                    <p>His Holiness Photius, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria, has
                        informed the Governor that he will in his sermon on Sunday next dwell upon
                        the necessity of peace and harmony between the Orthodox Greek population and
                        the natives. His Holiness has also enjoined the Orthodox clergy throughout
                        Alexandria , to endeavour to pacify any excitement among members of their
                        congregations.</p>
                    <p>The Latin Archbishop of Alexandria has also undertaken to use his influence
                        in the same direction.</p>
                    <p>FEARS FOR THE FUTURE.</p>
                    <p>Nervous people have been considerably alarmed by the very widespread rumours
                        as to a forthcoming renewal of the disturbance which it is alleged has been
                        timed to take place on Sunday next But the authorities are fully prepared
                        for any such renewal of the troubles and all precautions have been taken to
                        prevent any disorders again breaking out so there is not the slightest need
                        for any alarm.</p>
                    <p>TELEGRAM FROM MUSTAPHA PASHA KAMEL</p>
                    <p>The following telegram was received by us yesterday, too late for inclusion
                        in our issue of that day:--</p>
                    <p>Please read what I have written in the "Reforme" yesterday, so that yon may
                        know that I had always preached the harmony of the.Eyptians and the
                        Europeans residents, and that the accusing of the Egyptians and the leaders
                        of the public opinion in Egypt with fanatism is an absurd thing which
                        promotes discord and dissension. I believe that the difference in political
                        opinions does not tend to instigate the holders of such opinions to accuse
                        themselves injustly. I see that the interest of my country lies in the
                        preservance of peace and tranquillity. No one can say that I have said or
                        done the reverse. I affected that you will turn a deaf ear to the fabricated
                        and alarming reports promoted by the alarmists for personal prejudices and
                        especial designs and to interpret with great care what is published in the
                        Mohamedan newspapers about the Macedonian crisis before giving any decision
                        about their attitude. Had you done so you would have seen that the "Al Lewa”
                        is the mildest and most of all in exerting efforts to cultivate agreement
                        between the different nationalities in Egypt I am much astonished for yon
                        have not written any blaming word to the foreign rabbles who were the cause
                        of the Alexandrian disturbance. I believe that the only remedy to such
                        inconveniences is the allowing the Mixed Tribunals to settle criminal cases
                        committed by or against the foreigners for it is the only thing which

                    <head>LAST SUNDAY'S RIOT. CORRESPONDENT’S VIEWS</head>
                    <p>A well-known resident at Alexandria writes:—I would express the view, if you
                        will kindly permit me to do so through you, that it would be safer not to
                        belittle last Sunday’s disturbances. It is quite possible that had your
                        paper been rather more of an alarmist, you might have moved the authorities
                        to have been bettor prepared, and that, as a consequence, last Sunday’s riot
                        would have been suppressed with such promptitude and energy as to have
                        justified you in assuring the public now that no repetition of such
                        recurrences need be feared. As it is, rumour has it, in spite of everything
                        that the papers say, that next Sunday is to be the witness of a far more
                        grave state of things than last Sunday was, and this is repeated with such
                        assurance by so many months that many people are becoming seriously alarmed.
                        Of what use is it to be satisfied to merely state that there is no farther
                        occasion for alarm and to make other such like statements, as the papers are
                        now doing. These statements do not reassure people in the least, they are
                        simply a repeti tion of those made in 1882. What people want to know is what
                        precautions are being taken by the authorities against a repetition of
                        Sunday’s disturbances. They want to see there mentioned by newspapers, such
                        as your own, after due enquiry has been made. They want to learn if it is.
                        intended to deal severely and promptly with all disturbers' of the peace,
                        and, if so, they want such intentions to be made generally known. They want
                        to know if such enquiries are being made as to the original cause of last
                        Sunday’s rioting as will lead to the detection of the persons responsible
                        for the feeling which caused a mere gambling quarrel to assume the
                        proportions it did. They want aall this to be mads generally known in order
                        not only to judge if tranquillity has really been assured for the present,
                        but to serve as a lesson to persons interested in creating discord and riot
                        that their acts, however carefully hidden, will be certainly traced and
                        brought home to them with the utmost severity.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing, I venture to submit, will do more to allay toe fears of
                        nervous people than mere assurance and pooh-poohing the gravity of what has
                        taken place. It is quite correct to reassure our visitors the tourists, but
                        residents who are in continual touch with the natives' and know what is
                        really going on also require some consideration, and mere state menu that
                        all is now quiet will hardly satisfy them. The natives themselves, those who
                        desire law and order, require to be reassured also ; they are far from being
                        so at present Many of my native friends openly tell me they are much afraid
                        of farther disturbances business is also affected by the present state of
                        things. As to the villages, I fear that unless the authorities show a firm
                        hand and the intention to use most severe measures there may be trouble
                        there also.</p>

                    <head>THE CAPITULATIONS.</head>
                    <p>The disturbance on Sunday has led to a discussion of the part the
                        Capitulations played as a secondary cause.</p>
                    <p>"Al Moayad" is of opinion that the Capitula-tions are greatly to be blamed
                        for the outbreak at Alexandria, and it urges the Government to prevent
                        Europeans from carrying arms.</p>
                    <p>"Al Abram" says that the English want to use the disturbance as a lever to
                        obtain more power than before, and both "Al Lewa” and "Al Ahram” claim that
                        the Mixed Courts should be made competent in the case of European criminals.
                        His view is opposed to that of Lord Cromer, who states in his last Report
                        that "‘The proposal to transfer criminal jurisdiction over Europeans from
                        the consular to the Mixed Courts is not one which the British Government
                        could, under present circumstances , view with favor, nor one which they
                        could advise the Egyptian Government to accept."</p>

                    <p>The statement of accounts for the year ending 30th of June last is as
                        follows:--The trading profit for the year, including Government subsidies,
                        and after charging insurance of steamers, all salaries, office and general
                        expenses, has amounted to 76,985,17.7, to which is added for transfer fees
                        £2,12.6, making together £76,988.10.2. From which is deducted : D benture
                        interest, depreciation, directors’ and auditors' remuneration, £18,875.10.0,
                        leaving a balance of £58,113.0.1. The balance brought forward from the
                        previous year is £2,228.18.6, making a total of £60,841.18.7. Of this sum
                        dividends have been paid on the Preference shares for two-and-a half years
                        to 31st December , 1904, amounting to £37,491.9.6, leaving a balance of
                        £32,850.9.1. A farther dividend on Preference shares for the half-year
                        ending 30th June last was paid on September 30th, amounting to £ 1,497.16.0,
                        leaving a balance available for appropriation of £27,352.13.1.</p>
                    <p>The directors now recommend the payment of a dividend at the rate of 10 per
                        cent, on the Ordinary shares, payable on December 31st, which would absorb
                        £10,000.0.0, leaving a balance to be carried forward to next account of
                        £17,352.13.1.</p>
                    <p>The directors are pleased to report that doting the past year the vessels
                        have been well kept up. They have run free from any serious accidents, and
                        all services have been regularly maintained.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the increased volume of business the directors have contracted with
                        Messrs. Swan, Hunter and Wigham Richardson, Limited, for a new passenger
                        steamer, with all modern improvements, and calculated to maintain speed of
                        from 17 to 18 knots at sea. The directors hope that the new vessel will be a
                        profitable acquisition to the company's fleet, She is to be finished and
                        delivered in July next. Since the close of last year, two vessels, the
                        Keneh, of 1,581 tons, and the Kosseir, of 1,851. tons, have been purchased
                        and added to the company’s fleet.</p>
                    <p>To meet the requirements of the Egyptian authorities, a regular direct
                        service has been established between Suez and Suakin in connection with the
                        new railway, Suakin to Khartoum. Under an agreement with the Egyptian
                        Government a subsidy of £5,000 per annum (for five years) will be paid to
                        the company in consideration of its services in regard to this line.</p>

                        audience throughout the programme, and M. Pierre Loredan has to be
                        congratulated on the very excellent recital he gave at the Savoy yesterday
                        afternoon. It is only to be regretted that his concert had not been more
                        widely advertised, for though he early claimed the sympathies of his
                        audience the hall was never really full. M. Pierre Loredan plays with much
                        taste and subtle feeling, and his execution is excellent. He gave a very
                        fine rendering of Mendelssohn's "Rondo capriccioso,” and Chopin’s "Beroeuse”
                        was a delightful achievement. His "Il Tremolo,” by Gottsohalk, was excellent
                        is every way, his phrasing of the highest order. Perhaps it was the length
                        of the performance or a slight want of sympathy that prevented his doing
                        full justice to Raff's "Fileuse,” for his rendering of that delicate
                        "Gazouillement du printemps” by Sinding had been particularly graceful and
                        happy.</p>

                    <p>The second volume of the magnificent work "Recueil de Monumnets Egyptiens,"
                        of Monsieur Jean Capart, conservator of the Egyptian Museum in Brussels,
                        containing a further fifty heliogravare reproductions of Egyptian
                        antiquities, has just been published by M. Vromant. The monuments selected
                        for this series are fully as important and interesting as those of the first
                        volume, the photographs are as carefully prepared, and the accompanying
                        dissertation upon each precisely what is adequate. This time almost every
                        hieroglyphic text upon the objects is fully set forth in the essay referring
                        to it, and generally translated, so that the work is useful for students of
                        Egypt as well as for the history of Egyptian art.</p>
                    <p>As with the previous subjects selected, these are from collections generally
                        not in the large museums of European Capitals but in less visited places,
                        and many of the new plates reproduce relics at Athens, Brussels, Marseilles,
                        and University College, London. As far as convenient the chronological order
                        is followed in the arrangement of the plates, the series commencing with the
                        4th dynasty and terminating with a Byzantine tapestry. In reviewing such a
                        valuable work it is difficult to decide upon which of the heliogravures to
                        especially comment upon, but there are a certain number of them which to an
                        Egyptologist are peculiarly noteworthy. Of these plate 55, giving a statue
                        of marvellously fine workmanship yet dating as early perhaps as the 5th
                        dynasty, is specially interesting. The features are well preserved and the
                        head surmounted with a peculiar perruque, or wig, the plaits of which in
                        front are short, ending in the crown of the cranium, fresh ones commencing
                        there and falling down at the back to the neck. The waist cloth is pleeted
                        upon the right side of the body only. The pose of the body is precisely that
                        of the familiar later type of Egyptian human statues, but the porportions of
                        the figure are those of adolescence, the arms and legs being thin and the
                        general attitude not so rigid.</p>
                    <p>Plate 59 is a photograph of the Sphinx with human head, now in Louvre, and
                        supposed to have come from Tarsis. Although the head is somewhat mutilated
                        sufficient of the facial carving remains to show that it is of similar
                        physiognomy to the other celebrated Sphinx from the same site which in an
                        inscription upon it bore the name of Apepi, the Hyksos, or Shepherd king. It
                        was upon the features of this second human-headed Sphinx that many theories
                        of the ethnic affinities of the Hyksos were founded, until a Russian
                        Egyptologist, M. Golenischoff, proved that not only was the Apepi text not
                        the only one upon the statue, for it bore the name of Pisebkhenon of the
                        21st dynasty and that the latter's cartouche had been graven over an erasure
                        of some other Pharaoh's name, but that the king whose features it originally
                        represented was <persName>Amenemhat III</persName>., inscribed with his
                        name, at St. Petersburg, and of another similar statuette evidently of the
                        same personage, but without any inscription. The proof of identity and date
                        of production of the personage and monument, is not only derived from the
                        visage, but from the peculiar rayed headdress and also ibbed, or striated
                        shoulder covering. The Louvre sphinx bears texts of Rameses II., and his
                        son, Menepthas, inscribed over erasures of those of previous owners. Nothing
                        in Egyptian royal manners was, unfortunately, more de rigeur than to remove
                        the record of a previous Pharaoh from some valuable monument and substitute
                        another.</p>
                    <p>The Hyksos king may not have been the culprit in the case of the best
                        preserved of the Tanis sphinxes who thus wronged Amenemhat, but the deed may
                        have been done by orders of Pisebkhenon, whose cartouche placed upon the
                        breast has usurped the site where the original text was carved. The Apepi
                        name upon that sphinx is engraved on the shoulder, a Semitic practice
                        alluded to in the phrase "the Government shall be upon his shoulders." If
                        the Hyksos origin of these Tanis sphinxes and that of the similar typed
                        specimen from Bubastis has to be abandoned, all the voluminous essays upon
                        the racial connection of that mysterious people based upon them become
                        worthless. The idea was apparently fortified by the town of Tarris, whence
                        the earliest found sphinxes came, having been the Hyksos capital ; but other
                        specimens, possessing similar peculiarities, have been discovered at
                        Bubastis, and also up the Nile at El Kah, a site no Hyksos, save as a
                        prisoner, ever saw, whilst it formed part of Amenemhat III's kingdom. Why
                        the features of the 12th dynasty monarchy differed so much from those of
                        other Egyptian sovereigns is as yet undetermined.</p>
                    <p>For the next subject M. Capart has selected a head in the Egyptian collection
                        at University College, London, because it provides another portrait of
                        Amenemhat II. Unfortunately, the nose is partly broken away. It, however,
                        still remains a splendid specimen of Egyptian sculptures, and is perhaps the
                        most important phototype in this volume. It of course presents the same type
                        of rayed head dress, but in the case the remarkable arrangement of the rays
                        in groups of three is very manifest. Herr Borchardt believes this design to
                        be a peculiarity entirely of 12th dynasty Pharaonic statues and almost so of
                        those solely of Amenemhat II. As we are unable to illustrate those notes by
                        the head in question it will be well to quote. </p>

                    <head>THE SUEZ CANAL COLLISION. CLAIM FOR DAMAGES.</head>
                    <p>The collision of the S.S. Chathan and its subsequent blowing up in the Suez
                        Canal formed the subject of a claim by the owners of the vessel against the
                        owners of the Clan Cumming before the president and the Trinity Masters in
                        the Admiralty Court last week.</p>
                    <p>It appeared that on Sept. 5 of this year, shortly after seven p.m., the
                        Chatham lay in the Suez Canal on a voyage from London and the Elbe to
                        Bangkok and Yokohama, having on board a cargo which included 3600 cases of
                        dynamite and sixteen cases of detonators. The vessel stood near the eastern
                        bank, about a cable to the north of the tenth mile-post. The weather was
                        fine and clear, with a light wind blowing and the Clan Cumming came easily
                        along at about five miles an hour, bound for Port Said. As she approached
                        the Chatham she opened her masthead and both side lights, and when the two
                        vessels were about 1 1/2 mile distant from each other measures were taken
                        for the purpose of tying up the Chathan to allow the Clan Cumming to pass.
                        Engines were put to slow, dead slow, and then stopped. When from a quarter
                        to half a mile away the defendant's vessel, so the plaintiffs allege,
                        approached at a high rate of speed, and did not open her red light until a
                        very short distance off. When collision seemed imminent she sounded three
                        short blasts on the whistle, and immediately afterwards her stem struck the
                        starboard bow of the Chatham. It was a violent blow, cutting right into the
                        forecastle. The force of the collision cut down the bulkhead of the Chatham
                        causing the lamp attached to it to fall and set fire to the contents of the
                        forecastle. It became necessary to flood the forehold and submerge the
                        vessel in order to prevent the fire spreading to the explosives on board.
                        The Chatham was subsequently blown up by order of the Canal authorities.
                        Plaintiffs alleged that the Clan Cumming was handled improperly, nd that a
                        good look-out was not kept. They therefore claimed judgement against the
                        defendants and their bail for the damage caused to the plaintiffs by reason
                        of the collision ; also a reference to the Regustrar, assisted by merchants,
                        to assess the amount of the damage. </p>
                    <p>The defence was that lights were burning brightly on the Clan Cumming, and a
                        good look-out was also being kept. The egines were, on the approach, put at
                        half-speed, slowed down, and then stopped. Almost immediately afterwards the
                        engines of the Clan Cumming were put full-speed astern and three loud blasts
                        were sounded on the whistle, but the Chatham, which was heard to let go her
                        starboard anchor and to sound a blast, was seen to extinguish her lights,
                        and although the port anchor of the Clan Cumming was let go and held on to,
                        the Chatham, it was alleged, came on with considerable headway, and with her
                        starboard bow struck the stem of the Clan Cumming, inflicting considerable
                        damage. Defendants denied the allegations of improper handling, and
                        counterclaimed against the plaintiffs for damages in respect of the
                        collision.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Laing, K. C., Mr. Scrutton, K. C., and Mr. Dumas appeared for the
                        plaintiffs ; and the defendants were represented by Mr. Pickford, K. C., Mr.
                        Butler Aspinall, K. C., and Mr. Bullock.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Pickford, answering his lordship, said the real point was on the question
                        of speed. The rate at which the Chatham was travelling was, in his opinion,
                        excessive, having regard to the regulations of the canal.</p>
                    <p>Sir Gorell Barnes : What do you say was the speed of the Clan Cumming?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Pickford : Regulation speed, of course.</p>
                    <p>Witnesses were being called for the plaintiffs when the Court adjourned.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN LIGHT RAILWAYS. REPORT OF INSPECTOR.</head>
                    <p>An interesting report on the working of light railways throughout Egypt
                        during the past year has been made by Mr. Gunn, of the Railway
                        Administration. We extract the following passages :--</p>
                    <p>There has been added to the lines only 97 kilometres in all and a section of
                        10 kilometres closed, making an actual increase of 17 kilometres for the
                        year, giving a total of 1,107 kilometres for all three companies as compared
                        with 1,090 for the previous year. 15 kilometres have been opened since the
                        close of the companies' years by the Egyptian Delta Light Railway Co., and
                        they are constructing several other sections.</p>
                    <p>The total receipts of the three systems amounted to L.E. 171,067 for the
                        previous year. It will be seen by these figures that there is an increase of
                        thirty-eight thousand and eleven Egyptian pounds (L.E. 38,011) of which sum
                        L.E. 29,762 belong to the Egyptian Delta Light Railway Co.</p>
                    <p>The total number of passengers carried was over 5 3/4 millions (5,797,562),
                        an increase over the previous year of over one million. Of this total the
                        Delta Co. carried nearly 4 1/2 millions (4,478,403). Goods, 979,554 tons
                        lifted, as against 642,969 for 1903, showing an increase of 327,585. This
                        includes the transport of 195,195 tons of earth for reclaiming land by the
                        Delta Co. While the kilometrage practically remains the same, the gross
                        receipts show an increase on the total of L.E. 171,067 for 1903 equal to
                        22%. To this increase more than half is due to the passenger traffic, viz.:
                        L.E. 9,113. While the cotton crop was good and contributed to the great
                        increase over the last year, it is evident that a large factor has been the
                        through-booking with the Government Railways. Shippers are beginning to find
                        out that they can ship their goods to almost any part of the country while
                        remaining themselves at home, and are availing themselves of it. It does
                        not, however, seem to be generally known. I should like to call attention to
                        the fact that it is highly desirable to have this system throughout ; it is
                        not only profitable to the Light Railways, but also to the Government
                        Railways, which receive the greater proportion of the receipts. The Light
                        Railway Companies whose stations number in the neighborhood of 300 are
                        anxious to open them all to through-booking. The Government stations number
                        about 250. I would suggest that this matter should be taken up, and that
                        special notices should be distributed. </p>
                    <p>The chief cause of complaint against the companies has been the irregularity
                        of trains, and it can be partly accounted for by the wet and slippery state
                        of the agricultural roads during the rainy season. This can hardly be
                        avoided while the railways follow so closely the agricultural roads, where
                        there is a great deal of traffic and the rails get covered with the sticky
                        mud and retard the trains. However, a marked improvement can be noted over
                        the previous year, chiefly due to better supervision, more powerful engines,
                        and the increase of separate trains for goods on lines where traffic is
                        heaviest. The separation of passengers and goods is the only satisfactory
                        arrangement. If they are handled jointly one or the other must suffer.</p>

                        <p>The above teams met on Moharrem Bey common on Saturday last. This is the
                            second meeting this season, the first game having guide to the "Dube" by
                            5 goals to 1. The Saints were rther under strength, but never theless
                            the game was very evenly contested throughout, both defences having a
                            lot to do. The "Dubs" were the first to score, the ball being rushed
                            into the net by Leary after a misunderstanding between Davies and
                            Curtis. Saints tried hard to eqalise before the close of the half and
                            some good play by Constantinides brought the forwards well into the
                            "Dubs" territory. Bright had hard lines in not scoring from a clearance
                            by Nowland after the custodian had been hard pressed. All further
                            attacks were repulsed and half-time arrived with the scores : D Co. 1 ;
                            St Andrew nil.</p>
                        <p>The teams turned round without leaving the field and the second half
                            opened briskly. The "Dubs" looked like increasing their lead from a
                            brilliant individual effort by Coyne, who beat halves and backs alike,
                            but with only Curtis to beat the shot over the bar. The Saints then got
                            away on the right and Constantimidis took the ball well down, there
                            placing to centre. Bright took it up and passed to Jones, who very
                            smartly netted the ball. Being again on a level footing both teams tried
                            their utmost to obtain the lead, but all efforts were fruitless and time

                        <dateline>London, December 8.</dateline>
                        <p>The general feeling in the City is that whatever happens in Russia,
                            things here cannot be greatly disturbed. The monetary position is
                            thoroughly sound, speculative accounts are small and well in hand, and
                            while everybody is naturally cautious, nothing is likely to happen to
                            cause any kind of panic, even if the worst news came. Sometimes a state
                            of tension from absence of news (as is the case with Russia to-day. St.
                            Petersburg being satill practically cut off) is even worse than bad
                            news, and the fact that the markets are quite cool is sufficient to
                            indicate their being fully prepared for almost anything that might
                            happen. In the case of a very serious fall in Russian securities, it is
                            generally admitted that Germany is the weak spot. Not only have the
                            German banks a considerable quantity of Russian bonds, but the German
                            investor has absorbed a great many in recent times, and he is not in a
                            position to make big losses, as it admitted that Germany is in a very
                            poor condition financially, which is not improved by the announcement of
                            the very heavy new taxes which the Government are about to levy.</p>
                        <p>Although Germany is the weakest point to-day, we do not think there is
                            any serious catastrophe likely to happen in Berlin, and even should one
                            occur, in consequence of disastrous news from Russia, it is doubtful if
                            it would very seriously affect the position here. Money is
                            unquestionably accumulating, and it is thought that very considerable
                            sums are being brought from Russia for investment in this country, as is
                            usual in times of panic abroad. </p>
                        <p>It is true that the Bank of England might have a larger reserve, but with
                            a 4% rate and the proportion of reserve to liabilities 40.89%, it is
                            quite satisfactory, and is comparatively even more favorable than last
                            year with a rate 3% against 4% this year. While money is dear in New
                            York-as much as 25% has been paid for day to day money-no apprehension
                            need be felt, as the Secretary to the Treasury could at any time supply
                            more than the market could possibly require, as the Treasury holds the
                            enormous total of £148,000,000.</p>
                        <p>As against the absurd rates in New York, which, of course, are not
                            applied except for Stock Exchange speculative transactions, London's day
                            to day rate went down to 1% and there is every indication of continued
                            ease. This is largely the result of the meturing of large amounts of
                            Exchequer bons. With the discount houses reducing their deposit rates by
                            1%, the question of the reduction of Bank rate comes to the front, but
                            this is not considered likely for the present. Four per cent. is a
                            thoroughly wholesome rate for trade in its present active state, and it
                            is highly improbable any change will be made in the present condition of
                            political affairs.</p>

                        <p>Outside the heavy fall in South Eastern and Chatham Railway stocks, due
                            to the disastrous collapse of the roof of Charing Cross station, there
                            has been nothing of any moment during in home securities. It is reckoned
                            that the loss incurred by this accident, apart from the very great
                            inconvenience to which it has put the large number of Continental and
                            other travellers, will amount to a good half-a-million, and it seems to
                            be doubted in some quarters whether the opportunity will not be seized
                            to do away with this station altogether, which, with the bridge
                            connected with it, is architecturally one of the greatest eyesores in
                            the West of London. The shares have fallen to an extent that fully
                            reflects this loss, and other railways have to a certain extent
                            sympathised.</p>

                        <p>The Board of Trade returns just issued show a progressive increase in the
                            exports of considerable magnitude, and the fact that this increase
                            consists very largely of manufactured goods points to a condition of
                            trade with which the fuss about the unemployed seems very much out of
                            harmony. There is no doubt that this improvement in trade will be a
                            strong card in the hands of the enemies of Mr. Chamberlain, and will
                            probably have the effect of postponing Tariff Reform, at any rate for

                        <p>The increasing seriousness of the situation in Russia has naturally been
                            reflected in the movements of Russian bonds, which have this week
                            touched the lowest point since they were issued. There was a slight
                            recovery on Wednesday under the influence of a statement made by M.
                            Rouvier in the French Chamber to the effect that there would be
                            sufficient funds to secure the payment of the interest for two or three
                            years. This improvement has not, however, been maintained, and the bonds
                            leave off to-night at 8 0 1/2-1, a fall on the week of 3 points.</p>
                        <p>Earlier in the week there was some selling of the new Japanese loan by
                            applicants who had expected larger allotments, but the bonds generally
                            are steady. The new loan is quoted to-night at 15/16 prem. special
                            settlement, 11/16 for cash.</p>

                        not brought into sight, and say 5% for the usual corrections, which would
                        indicate a supply of 10 3/4 @ 11 million for the present season, plus the
                        stocks at the ports and at the American interior towns, and in the hands of
                        the consumers all the world over on the 31st August last, currently
                        estimated at 2 million bales. This would appear to be a very ample supply,
                        even allowing fully for the large consumption which it is believed will
                        exceed that of last season, although if the present high range of values is
                        to be maintained we doubt if it will reach such a figure. The South is
                        "bull" and planters are apparently determined and able to control the supply
                        and to command still higher prices in the immediate future, but we think the
                        trade of the world will gradually be adversely affected as time goes on and
                        that holders will not be able to realise the balance of this crop at such a
                        high level of prices. The latest values are delivery:--</p>

                    <p>The Oceana Consolidated Company, Limited, have, it is stated by a London
                        contemporary, recently sold in Liverpool a first consignment of 318 bales of
                        cotton grown on their plantation at Chiromo, British Central Africa, at an
                        average price of 8d- per pound. The cotton was grown from seed imported from
                        Egypt, and the company's brokers (Messrs. Wolstenholme and Holland) report
                        that if the plantation continues to produce quality equal to these early
                        shipments they will be enabled to compete with Egyptian cotton.</p>

                    <head>GOLD EXPORTS FROM EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>(From our Financial Correspondent).</p>
                    <p>London, December 8.</p>
                    <p>We hear of £200,000 in gold being shipped from Alexandria to India. There is
                        an expectation in money circles here that considerable shipments of gold may
                        be expected from Egypt. We fear this hope is doomed to be a disappointed
                        one. During 1904 the exports of bullion from London to Egypt amounted to
                        £4,632,000, but up to October this year Egypt appears to have taken in gold,
                        silver, bullion, and specie about £2,000,000 short of this amount. It is
                        doubtful whether, considering the large profits which have been made by the
                        growers in Egypt, any further substantial amount of gold will find its way
                        back here, beyond a few hundred thousand pounds. </p>
                    <p>The exports from Egypt last year, notwithstanding the above large imports,
                        were comparatively trifling, and up to the end of October of the present
                        year only about £270,000 had reached the United Kingdom from Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The money market must realise the fact that Egypt, like India, will be like a
                        leech, in absorbing the precious metals for some time to come. Fortunately,
                        the world's supplies of both gold and silver are so large, that what might
                        have been a serious factor in the monetary situation a few years ago is not
                        now likely to have any effect.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS.</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe. This
                        depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily, but
                        in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                        other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year,
                        for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to
                        go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily. Some will want to take into consideration
                        the number of days to be spent at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list
                        showing the time occupied on each of the various routes between Egypt and
                        the Continent of Europe. </p>
                    <p>They are as follows:--</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes--from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southampton,
                        London or Liverpool--occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as follows
                        :--</p>
                    <p>Port Said or Alexandria to Brindisi : 3 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Messina : 3 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said or Alexandria to Marseilles : 5 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Venice and Trieste : 4 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Naples : 3 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said to Genoa : 5 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said to Naples : 4 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Constantinople : 4 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Piraeus : 2 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said to Gibraltar : 7 days</p>
                    <p>The steamers, of the P. and O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg</p>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P. and O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste-Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves Port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian mails from
                        the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry boats," having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMINA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour.In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain - his
                        tomb is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO,
                        with about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay--Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cogwheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient halfway
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba)--The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature--warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn to Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Nilan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Dorino and in half an hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage, or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going nothwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot ; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two and three quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and grandeurs."</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one and a half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE--A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne facing the Rigi and
                        Pilatus and the snow-clad Alps.</p>
                    <p>In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be made
                        from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc. are very numerous.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the
                        Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axentrasse.</p>
                    <p>A delightful excursion from Lucerne is that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to
                        Stansstad and from Stansstad it is about 1 hour and 40 min. by Electric
                        Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand ; extending from
                        Monte Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhosn.</p>

                        views. There is a magnificent view of the Jungfrau from the Hoheweg, a fine
                        avenue of walnut trees the chief resort of visitors. Interlaken is also not
                        far from the famous waterfalls, Giessbach, Trummelbach, and Staubbach. Then
                        also the glaciers of the Grindelwald and view from Murren and the Schynige
                        Platte are sights not to be missed.</p>

                        from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are
                        those of he Khedivial Mail Co. and the Russian Steam Navigation Co.</p>
                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
                        in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be
                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara for
                        which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on account of the beauty of
                        the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail shooting to be had.</p>
