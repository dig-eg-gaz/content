                    <head>GOLD IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <head>THE RECENT IMPORTANT FINDS.</head>
                    <p>The recent discovery of gold in the western oases is of the first importance not only to the interests of the Corporation of Western Egypt but to the general development of the mining industry of the country. It affords a first indication of the actual direction in which the gold has drifted that must have been eroded from the eastern hills daring vast geological periods before man appeared in the Nile Valley, and also of the probable manner of its deposition.</p>
                    <p>So far as the immediate interests of the Corporation are concerned,2 dwts. per ton may not seem, at first sight, to be very important; but it is to be remembered that the gold is contained in pyrites which form generally more than one-tenth of the phosphate rook. This rook must in any case be powdered to be commercially useful, and when this is done the pyrites can be separated with very little expense, while the richness and commercial value of the phosphates are greatly enhanced by its removal.</p>
                    <p>The separated pyrites should then carry from half an ounce to an ounce per ton. and will be valuable as a source of sulphur and sulphuric acid, in addition to yielding this amount of gold. It will also be necessary to enquire what has become of the gold that has weathered out of the extensive phosphate outcrops  since the oases were first formed or since their formation commenced.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to say at present exactly where it may be found, but it is at least permissible  to hope that it is held within the oases area. Another point to be considered is what indication this discovery may give to aid in tracing and discovering the “deep leads” which very possibly exist between the gold belts of the Eastern hills and the oases. The discovery of such leads would give a new impulse to Egyptian mining, and might result in most important developments.</p>

                    <head>ASSOUAN RESERVOIR.</head>
                    <p>The adjudication on tenders for.the protec-tive works downstream of the looks at Assouan Reservoir has been settled in favor of the following contractors : —</p>
                    <p>L.E.
                        Urquhart and Williamson .... 4.889 G. Mitchell and Mohamed Ibrahim . . 8,033

                        W. H. Williamson...................... 3 350</p>
                    <p>The tender of Messrs. Urqnhart and William-son  for the supply of atone facings in hewn granite for the talus works downstream of the looks at Assouan Reservoir baa been accepted. It is for LE 10,200.</p>
                    <p>The above works are the result of 8ir Benjamin Baker's visit last season. Whenhe visited the work last winter, he recommended extensive protective works on the talus downstream of the dam, where the severe action of the water through he sluices had eroded even the sound granite. The P. W. D. had recognised the necessity of these protective works and had already commenced them, and had in 1901 completed the repairs of certain of the worst places, and were intending to spend a further sum of L.E 50,000 in 1905. Sir Benjamin, however, recommended protective works upon a still larger scale than this, which will involve an expenditure of something like a quarter of a million of money, and take two years to complete.</p>

                    <head>EXPEDITION FOR STUDYING THE NILE CATARACTS.</head>
                    <p>It has been decided to make a complete and detailed survey of the Nile cataracts, south of Wady-Halfa, and to study the possibility of constructing another dam and reservoir , somewhere to the south of the existing one. Such a supplementary work will probably be necessary, under any circumstances, even should the Assouan dam be raised, as the future wants of Egypt will necessitate a very large amount of water being stored, In any work of the kind, constructed south of Wady-Halfa, a navigation channel and looks may be omitted, as, with the railway from Wady-Halfa to Khartoum, no through river traffic is likely to arise, more especially as, on this reach of the river, it must always be difficult and dangerous, and only possible during flood.</p>
                    <p>The survey parties commenced work this autumn.</p>

                    <head>CAMPING OUT IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>There is some probability of the neighbourhood of the Ghizeh pyramids becoming a favorite site for a residential European tent dwelling colony. The Public Security Department of the Ministry of the Interior has determined that these squatters should not be permitted to pitch their tents there just as they please, and a notice has been issued wherein it is stated that it is forbidden to erect tents in the vicinity of the Ghizeh pyramids without a permit from the Ministry of tbs Interior.</p>
                    <p>Applications for such permits most be addressed to the Minister of the Interior. The name and surname of the Applicant, nationality, occupation and residence, together. with the number of tents, the site on which they are to be erected, and the period for which the permit is required, must be mentioned in the application.</p>
                    <p>This regulation is also to apply to the erection of tents in the neighbourhood of monuments of the past at Assouan.</p>

                    <head>QUIET AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                    <head>ACTION OF AUTHORITIES.</head>
                    <p>Yesterday no incident occurred at Alexandria to disturb public security, but the state of mind of a large portion of the European population is by no means tranquil. As an example of this feeling of insecurity we may instance the run on the shops of the gunsmiths yesterday. The police authorities thought that yesterday the panic had to all appearances so much subsided that it would be permissible to allow the gunsmiths' establishments to be reopened. But as soon as the decision of the authorities became known, there was a great rush to buy arms on the part of Europeans and a big trade was done in revolvers end other weapons. The authorities decided therefore to again order the closing of these shops, and this morning all of the gunsmiths were shut up and will remain so until further notice.</p>
                    <p>The police authorities ere quite satisfied that the attitude of the natives is peaceful, and they are in fact quite cowed. But the authorities state that they are afraid of the Europeans in their present excited state, and believe that if there is any renewal of the disturbance it will be provoked by the Europeans.</p>
                    <p>Morice Bey, Inspector of the Parquet at the Ministry of Justice, has arrived from Cairo in connection with the forthcoming trials of the persons accused of having taken part in the riot on Sunday afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Up to now no death has occurred among the Europeans and natives injured in the disorders. Mr. Marsden, the sub-manager of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank, is recovering from his wound, and will in all probability be able to resume his duties next week.</p>
                    <p>CONVOCATION OF SHEIKHS.</p>
                    <p>This morning and yesterday afternoon there were two important meetings of all the religious sheikha, who are accustomed to preach in the mosques at Alexandria. These meetings were convened by the order of Mahmoud Pasha 8idky, Governor of Alexandria, and all who were summoned attended. The Governor addressed the sheikhs on the subject of the recent disturbance and laid strict injunctions upon them all to use their best endeavours in their religious addresses to impress upon their hearers the need for calmness, as unless the populace preserved its self-control public security would again be disturbed. His Excellency's earnest exhortations had a great effect on his audience and all the sheikhs present this morning and at yesterday's meeting promised the Governor that they would be untiring in their efforts to use their religious influence in the interests of public tranquillity.</p>

                    <p>His Holiness Photius, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria, has informed the Governor that he will in his sermon on Sunday next dwell upon the necessity of peace and harmony between the Orthodox Greek population and the natives. His Holiness has also enjoined the Orthodox clergy throughout Alexandria , to endeavour to pacify any excitement  among members of their congregations.</p>
                    <p>The Latin Archbishop of Alexandria has also undertaken to use his influence in the same direction.</p>
                    <p>FEARS FOR THE FUTURE.</p>
                    <p>Nervous people have been considerably alarmed by the very widespread rumours as to a forthcoming renewal of the disturbance which it is alleged has been timed to take place on Sunday next But the authorities are fully prepared for any such renewal of the troubles and all precautions have been taken to prevent any disorders again breaking out so there is not the slightest need for any alarm.</p>
                    <p>TELEGRAM FROM MUSTAPHA PASHA KAMEL</p>
                    <p>The following telegram was received by us yesterday, too late for inclusion in our issue of that day:--</p>
                    <p>Please read what I have written in the "Reforme" yesterday, so that yon may know that I had always preached the harmony of the.Eyptians and the Europeans residents, and that the accusing of the Egyptians and the leaders of the public opinion in Egypt with fanatism is an absurd thing which promotes discord and dissension. I believe that the difference in political opinions does not tend to instigate the holders of such opinions to accuse themselves injustly. I see that the interest of my country lies in the preservance of peace and tranquillity. No one can say that I have said or done the reverse. I affected that you will turn a deaf ear to the fabricated and alarming reports promoted by the alarmists for personal prejudices and especial designs and to interpret with great care what is published in the Mohamedan newspapers about the Macedonian crisis before giving any decision about their attitude. Had you done so you would have seen that the "Al Lewa” is the mildest and most of all in exerting efforts to cultivate agreement between the different nationalities in Egypt I am much astonished for yon have not written any blaming word to the foreign rabbles who were the cause of the Alexandrian disturbance. I believe that the only remedy to such inconveniences is the allowing the Mixed Tribunals to settle criminal cases committed by or against the foreigners for it is the only thing which preserves the public security,—Mustapha Kamel Pasha.</p>

                    <head>LAST SUNDAY'S RIOT.</head>
                    <head>CORRESPONDENT’S VIEWS</head>
                    <p>A well-known resident at Alexandria writes:—I would express the view, if you will kindly permit me to do so through you, that it would be safer not to belittle last Sunday’s disturbances. It is quite possible that had your paper been rather more of an alarmist, you might have moved the authorities to have been bettor prepared, and that, as a  consequence, last Sunday’s riot would have been suppressed with such promptitude and energy as to have justified you in assuring the public now that no repetition of such recurrences need be feared. As it is, rumour has it, in spite of everything that the papers say, that next Sunday is to be the witness of a far more grave state of things than last Sunday was, and this is repeated with such assurance by so many months that many people are becoming seriously alarmed. Of what use is it to be satisfied to merely state that there is no farther occasion for alarm and to make other such like statements, as the papers are now doing. These statements do not reassure people in the least, they are simply a repeti tion of those made in 1882. What people want to know is what precautions are being taken by the authorities against a repetition of Sunday’s disturbances. They want to see there mentioned by newspapers, such as your own, after due enquiry has been made. They want to learn if it is. intended to deal severely and promptly with all disturbers' of the peace, and, if so, they want such intentions to be made generally known. They want to know if such enquiries are being made as to the original cause of last Sunday’s rioting as will lead to the detection of the persons responsible for the feeling which caused a mere gambling quarrel to assume the proportions it did. They want aall this to be mads generally known in order not only to judge if tranquillity has really been assured for the present, but to serve as a lesson to persons interested in creating discord and riot that their acts, however carefully hidden, will be certainly traced and brought home to them with the utmost severity.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing, I venture to submit, will do more to allay toe fears of nervous people than mere assurance and pooh-poohing the gravity of what has taken place. It is quite correct to reassure our visitors the tourists, but residents who are in continual touch with the natives' and know what is really going on also require some consideration, and mere state menu that all is now quiet will hardly satisfy them. The natives themselves, those who desire law and order, require to be reassured also ; they are far from being so at present Many of my native friends openly tell me they are much afraid of farther disturbances business is also affected by the present state of things. As to the villages, I fear that unless the authorities show a firm hand and the intention to use most severe measures there may be trouble there also.</p>

                    <head>THE CAPITULATIONS.</head>
                    <p>The disturbance on Sunday has led to a discussion of the part the Capitulations played as a secondary cause.</p>
                    <p>"Al Moayad" is of opinion that the Capitula-tions are greatly to be blamed for the outbreak at Alexandria, and it urges the Government to prevent Europeans from carrying arms.</p>
                    <p>"Al Abram" says that the English want to use the disturbance as a lever to obtain more power than before, and both "Al Lewa” and "Al Ahram” claim that the Mixed Courts should be made competent in the case of European criminals. His view is opposed to that of Lord Cromer, who states in his last Report that "‘The proposal to transfer criminal jurisdiction over Europeans from the consular to the Mixed Courts is not one which the British Government could, under present circumstances , view with favor, nor one which they could advise the Egyptian Government to accept."</p>

                    <p>The statement of accounts for the year ending 30th of June last is as follows:--The trading profit for the year, including  Government subsidies, and after charging insurance of steamers, all salaries, office and general expenses, has amounted to 76,985,17.7, to which is added for transfer fees £2,12.6, making together £76,988.10.2. From which is deducted :
                        D benture interest, depreciation, directors’ and auditors' remuneration, £18,875.10.0, leaving a balance of £58,113.0.1. The balance brought forward from the previous year is £2,228.18.6, making a total of £60,841.18.7. Of this sum dividends have been paid on the Preference shares for two-and-a half years to 31st December , 1904, amounting to £37,491.9.6, leaving a balance of £32,850.9.1. A farther dividend on Preference shares for the half-year ending 30th June last was paid on September 30th, amounting to £ 1,497.16.0, leaving a balance available for appropriation of £27,352.13.1.</p>
                    <p>The directors now recommend the payment of a dividend at the rate of 10 per cent, on the Ordinary shares, payable on December 31st, which would absorb £10,000.0.0, leaving a balance to be carried forward to next account of £17,352.13.1.</p>
                    <p>The directors are pleased to report that doting the past year the vessels have been well kept up. They have run free from any serious accidents, and all services have been regularly maintained.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the increased volume of business the directors have contracted with Messrs. Swan, Hunter and Wigham Richardson, Limited, for a new passenger steamer, with all modern improvements, and calculated to maintain speed of from 17 to 18 knots at sea. The directors hope that the new vessel will be a profitable acquisition to the company's fleet, She is to be finished and delivered in July next. Since the close of last year, two vessels, the Keneh, of 1,581 tons, and the Kosseir, of 1,851. tons, have been purchased and added to the company’s fleet.</p>
                    <p>To meet the requirements of the Egyptian authorities, a regular direct service has been established between Suez and Suakin in connection with the new railway, Suakin to Khartoum. Under an agreement with the Egyptian Government a subsidy of £5,000 per annum (for five years) will be paid to the company in consideration of its services in regard to this line.</p>

                    <head>SAVOY HOTEL</head>
                    <p>It is always difficult for a single artist to hold the attention of his audience throughout the programme, and M. Pierre Loredan has to be congratulated on the very excellent recital he gave at the Savoy yesterday afternoon. It is only to be regretted that his concert  had not been more widely advertised, for though he early claimed the sympathies of his audience the hall was never really full. M. Pierre Loredan plays with much taste and subtle feeling, and his execution is excellent. He gave a very fine rendering of Mendelssohn's "Rondo capriccioso,” and Chopin’s "Beroeuse” was a delightful achievement. His "Il Tremolo,” by Gottsohalk, was excellent is every way, his phrasing of the highest order. Perhaps it was the length of the performance or a slight want of sympathy that prevented his doing full justice to Raff's "Fileuse,” for his rendering of that delicate "Gazouillement du printemps” by Sinding had been particularly graceful and happy.</p>

                    <p>The Tewfik Palace Hotel have inaugurated this season a fortnightly trip by river to the Barrage. The launches used on these trips belong to the Anglo-American Nile 8teamer and Hotel Company, and passengers are conveyed from the hotel to the river, where the launches await them. Lunch and tea are to be had on board, but on the return journey passengers will be landed at the Kasr-el-Nil Bridge in order that they may arrive back at Helouan in time for dinner. The first trip was made yesterday, and the next one is arranged for Wednesday, 27th inst.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hergel, who has contributed during the past two years by no means a small part towards the rising popularity of the Tewfik Palace Hotel, distinguishes himself as manager by giving an excellent cuisine, so as to content the most refined epicures. His object is to combine the advantageous position of the hotel with an excellent table, and we can only say he quite realises his ambition and thereby con-siderably adds to the inner comforts of those choosing the late Khedive's Palace as a winter resort.</p>
