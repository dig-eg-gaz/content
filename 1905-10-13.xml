                        capital, on Thursday at daylight. His visit this autumn to those waters is
                        memorable by reason of the exceptional conditions under which it is being
                        paid, and the Japanese Navy Department has resolved that the re- ception of
                        the British vessels shall be indi- cative of the strong friendship which now
                        indubitably exists between the allied peoples. At the moment that he entered
                        the gulf Admiral Noel was within a few miles of Uraga, the spot where
                        Commodore Perry made his historic attempt in 1858 to open up communication
                        between the then se- cluded Japanese nation and the outside world. Perry's
                        success came in the following year, when on calling at Uraga to receive the
                        promised reply from the Japanese Government to President Fillmore's
                        courteous communica- ion he was hospitably entertained ashore, and he
                        subsequently steamed with his four vessels into the gulf until he was off
                        Shinagawa, the southern suburb of Tokio. Little could it have been imagined
                        that half a century later a Japanese fleet of something like 200 warships of
                        all sizes would lie just within the bay, many of them fresh from a campaign
                        against one of the greatest Powers of the Occident, awaiting the arrival of
                        a squadron flying the flag of a Western ally. Yet these figures represent
                        approximately the naval strength which Japan exhibited off Yokosuka, when
                        the Emperor journeyed thither from Tokio, 30 miles distant, to review his
                        victorious fleet. Admiral Togo's wonderful success at Tau-shima Straits
                        relieved the mind of his countrymen of a terrible burden of anxiety, and his
                        prowess has been fittingly acknowledged on all sides, but the forthcoming
                        review by the Emperor will set the seal of the Sovereign's approval on the
                        achievements of the Navy in general, and the day will be regarded as one to
                        be remembered in Japan for all time. Yokusuka itself has associations for
                        Englishmen which ought to be better known and appre- ciated, for not only
                        was it the first naval depot to be constructed by our allies, but it is the
                        burial place of Will Adams, the Ro- therhithe shipwright who found himself
                        strand- ed in Japan at the end of the sixteenth cen- tury, and quickly made
                        himself so useful to the reigning Shogun, the founder of the Tokugawa line,
                        as to be retained perma- nently in the country's service. Adams was the
                        first to hold the appointment, it may be said, of Chief Constructor of the
                        Japanese Navy, and his memory is cherished in Tokio to this day, where there
                        is a street- An-Jin-Cho- named after him. An-jin, it should be un- derstood,
                        means "pilot," and it was as a pilot on board a Dutch vessel that Adams
                        reached Japan in the first place. His grave is on a hill overlooking
                        Yokosuka, the tiny fishing village which has grown into a great naval
                        station, all within thirty-five years, and will form this week the centre of
                        an unparalleled demonstration of maritime pro- gress and rapidly-acquired
                        efficiency.</p>
                    <p>The British squadron has been welcomed in truly regal fashion, and all
                        classes have shown how thoroughly they enter into the meaning, and spirit of
                        the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. It is the custom throughout Japan to display on
                        annual festival days at windows and doorways the national flag of a red ball
                        on a white ground, and in a village street so decorated the effect is
                        usually very pretty. On the present occasion the Japanese and British flags
                        have flown together and Admiral Noel's officers and men have been everywhere
                        enthusiastically entertained, apart from the more formal banqueting that is
                        to take place in their honor in the capital. The Maple Club, at which the
                        British officers met the Cabinet Ministers and representative officers of
                        the Japanese Army and Navy, had its origin in very humble begin- nings in
                        the early Seventies, when a few Japan- ese and European residents
                        foregathered for sociable converse and recreation not far from the spot
                        where stands the commodious club- house of to-day. The roll of membership is
                        now a long one, for the members are to be courted by the thousand, and there
                        will be no mistak- ing the character of the reception which will be accorded
                        the British guests when they reach the Maple Club's hospitable doors. It is
                        a happy coincidence that the ratification of the Peace Treaty between Japan
                        and Russia will occur simultaneously with the visit of the British Squadron
                        and the grand naval review in the Tokio Gulf, for a settled conviction has
                        now taken possession of the Japanese mind that the durable peace which was
                        longed for has become assured to the nation, by means of its alliances with
                        Great Britain.</p>

                        <p>Cab-Drivers in Egypt.- “El Lewa” states than an edict was recently issued
                            by the Ministry of the Interior by which all cab- drivers who are not
                            possessed of the sight of both eyes were forbidden to continue in that
                            business. Several of these, who foresaw the difficulty of earning their
                            daily bread by other means, took action against H.E. Mustafa Pasha
                            Fahmi, president of the Council of Ministers, at the Court of Szida
                            Zenab. In their action they demanded that either the edict should be
                            repealed or that all their former colleagues in business, who are
                            afflicted with the same trouble, should have their licenses taken away.
                            The Muhzir of the Court has since intimated to his Excel- lency that the
                            demand of the plaintiffs must be acceded to, failing which he will be

                        <p>Horrible Murder.- A fellah of Tawabieh, Desneh Markaz, recently accured
                            his wife of stealing his two guns and giving them to one of her
                            relatives. Though he does not seem to have made his accusation good, he
                            resolved to kill her during her sleep and struck her re- peatedly on the
                            head with a naboot. Believing that he had disposed of her he then went
                            to the Omdeh and informed him that thieves bad broken into his house.
                            The Omdeh went to the house at once and found that the woman had
                            partially recovered from the stunning effect of blows. He asked her
                            whether she knew the naname of the thief. “It was my husband” was her
                            reply. The Omdeh instantly left the house to inform the proper
                            authorities and the husband, fearing further disclosures, cut the
                            unfortunate woman’s tongue out. The victim of this appalling act of
                            savagery has since succumbed to her injuries. The husband has been
                            imprisoned and will, we hope, receive the sentence which he
                            deserves.</p>

                    <p>A collision occurred here shortly before mid- night, when a pilot engine
                        crashed into a goods train coming from Alexandria made up of trucks
                        principally laden with vegetables. The pilot engine was shunting, and whilst
                        crossing the connection between the up and down lines met the up goods train
                        which was running into the station. Coming into collision with one of the
                        trucks, the momentum of the engine carried it over the goods train, and two
                        trucks were badly broken, while six others were derailed and lay across both
                        lines.</p>
                    <p>The sleeping car trains which were due to meet at Kafr el Zayat at 2.50 a.m.
                        both found the lines completely blocked and the passen- gers were
                        transferred from one train to the other, each of which returned to the
                        station from which it had started. At the time of wiring both lines are
                        still blocked, the cranes for removing the derailed trucks only having
                        arrived an hour ago, but it is expected that the traffic will be able to be
                        resumed without interruption by noon. Two of the fireman of the pilot engine
                        were slightly injured, but no other accidents to persons are recorded. The
                        accident is said to be the fault of the driver of the pilot engine but no
                        definite conclusion has been arrived at.</p>
                    <p>The sleeping-car train which left Alexandria At 11:30 last night returned
                        this morning about 9 o’clock with the passengers who had taken the
                        corresponding train from Cairo and it was not until nearly 11 a.m. that the
                        mails were delivered. We hear that one of the lines at Kafr el Zayat was
                        cleared by 10 a.m. and that both early morning expresses have get past the
                        scene of the accident. The dining-car expresses left their respective
                        stations up to time, and it is not anticipated that they will suffer any
                        delay.</p>
                    <p>Kafr el Zayat station must have been an Exciting spot in which to pass last
                        night, for The collision was not the only event that dis- turbed its
                        occupants. A fire broke out among a number of cotton bales, and serious
                        damage would have been caused, had it not been for the energetic measures of
                        the railway officials, who finally extinguished the flames.</p>

                    <p>The prophecy which appeared in the Egyp- tian Press some two months ago, that
                        Abd-ul- llsh Pasha would certainly succeed the late Aun-Er-Rafik Pasha as
                        Sherif of Mecca is now unlikely to be fulfilled. The Vali of the Hedjaz
                        appears to have protested against Abd-ul-IIah’s appointment to the "Mabein”
                        on the ground of his religious influence among the more austere moslems of
                        the vilayet. The foot that the late Sherif of Mecca had received letters
                        from the Imam Yahya Ibn Hamid el-Din of the Yemen, naturally made the
                        Turkish Go- vernment very nervous of appointing any Arab to the Sherifat
                        whose personal influence might possibly be thrown into the balance against
                        the Ottoman power, and Ali Pasha, Abd-ul-IIah’s cousin will almost certainly
                        succeed the late Sherif Auner Rafik.</p>

                        <p>The last batch of vessels from Suez arrived here this morning and again,
                            every berth in the harbour is occupied. Great difficulty was experienccd
                            in mooring these vessels, owing to the heavy sea which was running at
                            the time. I hear from a reliable source that after to-day vessels will
                            be able to enter the canal any time during the day. No ships have yet
                            been allowed to pass kilometre 18.4 after sunset, and from what I hear
                            they will not be allowed to do so this week.</p>
                        <p>The S.S. Dalmatia, which arrived here this morning from Caloutta bound to

                    <p>The prospects of our town team are distinct- ly rosy. Most of last year's
                        players are avail- ble,and there are also several newcomers who will t lay
                        for Port Said, and as some of these are said to be especially good players,
                        the old members will have to play up if they wish to keep their places. The
                        season does not open till November, when they will encounter their local
                        rivals the Suez E.T.C. Club. The latter team are also looking forward to an
                        im- proved condition of things, and they are not without hope that the boot
                        will be on the other leg, and that Captain Wallis and his men will on that
                        occasion have to take a second place. —But we shall see.</p>

                        jects no exact estimate can be made of the foreign population. The census of
                        June 1897, gave this at 35,219, but this figure must have been considerably
                        augmented since then and the inhabitants of European nationality must number
                        quite 50,000.</p>
                    <p>The same tables give the number of the native population of Alexandria on the

                        are those of the last census. </p>

                    <byline>(From our Correspondent.)</byline>
                    <dateline>Nicosia, October 9. </dateline>
                    <p>The Annual Fair and Horse Show was held At Omodhos, near Troodos, on the 27th
                        ult. The fair, which is primarily of a religious character, is one of the
                        most important, and villagers to the number of several thousands annually
                        flock to it to worship at the little church, where a piece of the true cross
                        and rope are exhibited. The fair is one of conside- rable interest to the
                        ordinary European tourist, as the peasants are for the most part seen in all
                        their finery and a considerable trade in the products peculiar to the Island
                        may be seen in progress. Thither also the dealers in "anticas" find their
                        way, and among the trash which they there try to dispose of may often be
                        discovered by the “knowing’’ ones some pretty and genuine specimens of
                        native silver and other work. The Horse Show is a development of recent
                        years, and is organised under the aus- pices of the Committee for the
                        Improvement of Cyprus Stock. There had been no show for two years, but the
                        entries appeared up to the former average, and it is hoped that every year
                        greater interest will be evinced by native owners of horses and donkeys. An
                        excellent lunch and tea were kindly provided by three ladies, wives of
                        English officials, to which about 60 guests sat down. His Excellency the
                        High Commissioner and Lady King Harman, with their daughter and Mr. Lewis
                        Biddulph, were present, who, when the proceedings termina- ted, started off
                        for a three days’ tour in the district. Colonel Griffiths, Army Veterinary
                        surgeon from Cairo, was among the judges.</p>

                    <p>Captain Kennedy, who as A.D.C. to General Bullock, came to Cyprus a few weeks
                        back, succumbed shortly after his arrival on Trodos to enteric fever, which
                        he doubtless contract- ed before leaving Egypt. He is now said to be
                        progressing favorably. Captain Lear- month, the new Chief Commandant of Po-
                        lice crossed over to Port Said some three weeks ago in order to meet his
                        wife and children. Owing to the illness of one of the latter has has been
                        detained at that port. Lieut. Creichton and Mr. Deedes (King's Royal Rifles)
                        arrived in Cyprus by last mail, and joined the detachment in camp at Troo-
                        dos. Mr. A. Graunum, Local Auditor, left for England last week on leave of
                        absence. </p>

                    <p>Advantage was taken of the presence on Trodos of several newcomers, who had
                        ar- rived for the Omodhos Show, to give a Dramatic Performance and Variety
                        Enterain- ment in the Soldiers' Recreation Room, on the 27th ultimo. Several
                        ladies and gentle- men assisted in the theatricals, and the “Tommies"
                        contributed the variety entertain- ment between the two plays. Both pieces
                        were excellently acted, and were highly appre- ciated by a numerous
                        audience. The regi- ment must also be congratulated upon the conspicuous
                        musical talent of several of the men. As a wind-up to a festive week, a
                        capital dance was given on the 29th by the Officers of the regiment in the
                        newly built hotel, which was kept up with mnch spirit to a late hour.</p>
