                    <p>months ago, it will be remembered, tha wear ers, after long negotiations,
                        wait conceded an adtaioe in wages of 7|%, end as ana total »corollary of
                        their success the card-room operatives are now demanding an increase of 6%.'
                        Ihe Utter have emphasised their determination to force the bands oi the
                        employer* by delivering one month's notice to cease vrotk if their claims
                        are not met It is stated by those who are wall able to give an opinion
                        that</p>
                    <p>»a the rise is conceded there will inevitably a* strike at the beginning of
                        May.</p>
                    <p>These frequent dispute! are mnoh to be deplored, not only from the point of
                        view of the personal interests ot masters and Man, bat also, became of the
                        serious menace to the trade of the County Paletiue and, incidentally, tbs:
                        contrary generally that Is involved. There is much to be said for the
                        position taken op by. the operatives. During the past eighteen months the
                        oottpn industry has enjoyed' ancx ampled prosperity, and fheuoesanel profits
                        have bean realised by owners <hi rend="italic">of</hi> mills It therefore,
                        to be expected that the workpeople should desife to share some of the
                        benefit* of the boom. The reasonable as of this is admitted, hot it is
                        unfortunate that it should seem to be neoessary, to order that justiod may
                        be done, to resort to the old and very unsatii factory medium of a strike, a
                        medium which, in the past, has wrought great havoc to all</p>
                    <p>engaged in the industry as well as to thousands who are affected by its
                        prosperity or its slackness.</p>
                    <p>It is true that there is now to be observed a more common-sense view of the
                        relations be tween mastora and man that has hitherto been absent, and the
                        dispute last autumn led the offioUls to consider the advisability of
                        adopting some system by which wages oould bo automatically fixed. ' We
                        understand that Ibe matter is .»till under consideration. This is
                        satisfactory, and it is to be hoped that »some</p>
                    <p>concerned) may be speedily aocumt iumed. We would suggest that the present
                        seems a gooff opportunity to complet this, so that we may be spared the
                        anxiety of another deadlock next month, The cotton industry is still

                        great. deal to be lost by arbitrary conduct «either »ide, and the
