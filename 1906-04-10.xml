                    <p>months ago, it will be remembered, tha wear ers, after long negotiations,
                        wait conceded an adtaice in wages of 7|%, end as ana total »corollary of
                        their success the card-room operatives are now demanding an increase of 6%.'
                        Ihe Utter have emphasised their determination to force the bands oi the
                        employer* by delivering one month's notice to cease vrotk if their claims
                        are not met It is stated by those who are wall able to give an opinion
                        that</p>
                    <p>»a the rise is conceded there will inevitably a* strike at the beginning of
                        May.</p>
                    <p>These frequent dispute! are mnoh to be deplored, not only from the point of
                        view of the personal interests ot masters and Man, bat also, became of the
                        serious menace to the trade of the County Paletiue and, incidentally, tbs:
                        contrary generally that Is involved. There is much to be said for the
                        position taken op by. the operatives. During the past eighteen months the
                        oottpn industry has enjoyed' ancx ampled prosperity, and fheuoesanel profits
                        have bean realised by owners <hi rend="italic">of</hi> mills It therefore,
                        to be expected that the workpeople should desife to share some of the
                        benefit* of the boom. The reasonable as of this is admitted, hot it is
                        unfortunate that it should seem to be neoessary, to order that justiod may
                        be done, to resort to the old and very unsatii factory medium of a strike, a
                        medium which, in the past, has wrought great havoc to all</p>
                    <p>engaged in the industry as well as to thousands who are affected by its
                        prosperity or its slackness.</p>
                    <p>It is true that there is now to be observed a more common-sense view of the
                        relations be tween mastora and man that has hitherto been absent, and the
                        dispute last autumn led the offioUls to consider the advisability of
                        adopting some system by which wages could bo automatically fixed. ' We
                        understand that Ibe matter is .»till under consideration. This is
                        satisfactory, and it is to be hoped that »some</p>
                    <p>concerned) may be speedily aocumt iumed. We would suggest that the present
                        seems a gooff opportunity to complet this, so that we may be spared the
                        anxiety of another deadlock next month, The cotton industry is still

                        which forms part of the property formerly belonging to the late Sabit Pacha

                    <p>In the House of Commons, last Monday, Mr. Bennett asked whether, in view of

                        the principle of arbitration in international disputes, they would offer to
                        submit to arbitration the question whether or not Tabah was an integral

                    <p>Mr. Ranciman said the Government had no reason to suppose that the question,

                        generally admitted. The rolling stock at the disposal of the tailway
                        department was barely sufficient for the Halfs line, but now it has to be
                        divided up between three lines. The dis location of business caused by the
                        sudden change and the 'insufficiency of the rolling stock has been enormous.

                        are accumulat ing at the port of entry and at Halts, and whereas it formerly
                        took one month for goods to come from Egypt via Halfa, six weeks is now

                        the kind of enthusiast who employs others to do the hard work. Het thinks

                    <p>MISS MARY HALL'S EXPERIENCES.</p>
                    <p>INTERESTING INTERVIEW.</p>
                    <p>Miss Mary Hall, whose journey across Atrica, was recently mentioned in our
                        columns, has just arrived in London, and has been relating her
                        experiences.</p>
                    <p>Miss Hall started her tour at Chinde, on the coast of Portuguese East Africa
                        in June last. and reached Cairo about seven weeks ago. She had previously
                        journeyed from the Cape to Victoria Falls.</p>
                    <p>During the whole of this nine months' journey she had a guard of only thirty
                        negroes, which, considering the innumerable dangers to the traveller in
                        unexplored Africa, was not strong one.</p>
                    <p>Except for my thirty bearers and porters, and my personal boy, I travelled
                        alone," she said in the interview. For weeks at a time I saw no whites, and
                        for weeks more had to subsist on jam, rice, cor flower, porridge, and cocos,
                        I travelled where no white women, and only two white men, have,trod.</p>
                    <p>"I was carried in a hammock by reliefs of four, and for several weeks
                        journeyed up rivers in a rowing boat, camping out on the banks at night.
                        Often, on pitching camp, I have heard lions and hippopotami all around me,
                        and have made my men form a complete circle of blazing fires round my tent.
                        Sometimes I was frightened, for I knew that a rhino, if he chose, could
                        crush me and my tent with one stroke of his forefoot,</p>
                    <p>"Lions, too, used to roar in the forest near me. I knew, however, that my
                        men, for their own sakes, would keep up the fires, and I very Boon got used
                        to it.</p>
                    <p>"My most exciting time was on the borders of German. South-West Africa: I
                        could not for several weeks get permission to continue my journey, for there
                        had been a vision of the natives, Finally I was allowed to proceed with a
                        guard of two soldiers.</p>
                    <p>These soldiers as nearly as possible caused an attack by the natives. They
                        wanted two of them to show us the way to the next river, and instead of
                        asking if they could have them they carried off two by force. We had not
                        gone far when I was told that several hundred of the tribe were pursuing us.
                        They poured over the side of a hill just behind us, yelling their battle
                        cries and brandishing their spears.</p>
                    <p>"I gave orders for a halt to be made, got out of my hammock, and faced them.
                        On they came, but when a few yards off hesitated. I at once went forward,
                        asked for the chief, and when he appeared I motioned the rest back. I was
                        considerably disturbed when I found that we had carried off two of the
                        tribe's principal men, but I explained that it was not done with my
                        permission, and eventually managed to smooth things over." Miss Hall has
                        many other adventures to tell. The very opposite of the popular idea of
                        pioneer, she is a medium-sized lady with an open face and mild grey eyes.
                        But there. is a firmness of mouth and chin, and a wideness of brow which is

                    <head>BRITISH CONSULAR COURT.</head>
                    <p>CHARGE OF ASSAULT.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday, Spiro Ellal, a Maltese and British subject, was brought before
                        H.B.M.'s- Cons lar Court, Cairo, charged with stabbing one Raffaele Grech
                        Cumbo on March 31. Mr. Alban, H.B.M.'s Consul, pre ided over the
                        proceedings. The evidence of Mr. Fests, by whom the victim had been
                        employed, was to the effect that the accused had been employed by Combo to
                        do painting work... Witness had employed Cumbo. recently.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Walter Innes Bey described the affair, which he witnessed from a verandah
                        near the corner where Safa-street joins the Sharia Madabegh. The accused and
                        a man in a straw. hat, who were talking, came to words, and the latter
                        finally struck accused, who threw himself on him. The two fell, the accused
                        uppermost, and witness was surprised to hear loud shrieks from Arab women,
                        not realising himself that anything serious had occurred. The Bocused rose
                        and moved away, and witness them saw that he carried a knife which resembled
                        that produced in Court. The wounded man turned and attempted to pursue
                        Ellal, who then made off. Cumbo was much put about the face when witness
                        came down to see him, his eye brows and forehead were gashed, and he was
                        covered with blood. A kn fa thrust in the left side had passed between two
                        ribs and must have been dangerously near the heart. The wounded man was
                        taken to the Victoria Nurs ing Home and admitted on its being known. that
                        Mr. Fests had employed him...</p>
                    <p>Mr. J. S Coronel, on being sworn, déposed that while driving up to Safa
                        street he raw a orowd of people shouting and rushing about. He drove up and
                        saw accused making off towards Messra Garrozo's works. He did not witness
                        the encounter but saw the wounded man. His description of the injuries Cambo
                        had sustained tallied with that given by Innes Bay. He desoribed the capture
                        of accused by an arbagi and added that the natives struck him while he was
                        held. He remonstrated with them, and stopped them. Acoused's knife was
                        identified by him and he gave an account of the first aid. measures that
                        were taken and of Cumbo's removal to the Victoria Nursing Home, The shawish
                        who took Blul into custody and the arbagi who captured him were also
                        examined, their evidence confirming that' already given in several
                        details.</p>

                        in waiting to convey the party to their goal. An unfortun ate sccident
                        occurred here to one of Mr. Gould's nieces, who was thrown from her camel,
                        and fainted. Her injuries were such that Mr. and Mrs. Gould had to take her
                        back at once to Alexandria. We hear this morning that no hones were broken
                        but the young lady is severely bruised. The ride Boross the breezy Mariout
                        op'anda to the rising ground on which Taposiris stands was &amp; pleasant
                        journey and the destination was soon reached. After climbing about the
                        great. temple lanch was served, and afterwards Pro fessor Breccia gave the
                        following account of the ancient city::</p>
                    <p>A l'appui, des auteurs classiques Pline: Strabon, Ptolémée, Dioscoride,
                        Procope, Sté phane de Byzance qui nons ont laissé quelques renseignements
                        sur la ville de Taposiris Magna, le Dr. Breccia démontre qu'il n'y a aucun
                        doute pour l'identification des ruines que nous avons visitées. Ces raines
                        sont bien celles de Taposiris Magos, comme d'ailleurs les voya geurs Pacho,
                        Minutoli, Robecchi, Brichetti et le savant Mahmoud El-Falaki avaient déjà
                        reconnu. Le Dr. Breccia &amp; même rappele qu'en 1902, Mr. Pachandski, le
                        géologue bien conna de notre ville, avait signalé l'endroit à l'attention de
                        l'Institut Egyptien comme digne d'être exploré et qu'après lui l'archéologue
                        Sokiff accompagné de notre concitoyen, Carl Herold, avait pas é oing jours
                        sur les lieux pour copier les inscriptions. peintes qu'on avait
                        observéesdans un tombeau à coupole à demi déblayé. Anjourd'hui, ajoute le
                        Dr. Breccia, d'autres.ins criptions assez modernes, dont les auteurs
                        méritent qu'on leur décerne un diplome de. stupidité viennent augmenter les
                        anciennes, et il recommande à ses amis les excursionistes de ne pas se
                        rendre dignes de ce diplome, Tout de suite après m'être orienté sur les
                        travaux les plus urgents que j'avais A accomplir à Alexandrie, j'ai porté
                        mon attention sur. Taposiris Magna et proposé &amp; M. le Directeur Général,
                        le professeur Maspero, un projet pour l'exploration superficielle du Mariont
                        et pour des fouilles systématiques faire dans la Ville mentionnée plus haut.
                        J'ai fait cela non seulement dans un bat seientifique, mais encore pour
                        tacher de créer à Alexandrie et dans ses environs les curiosités
                        indispensables à retenir les touristes, parce que je pense qu'on devrait
                        commencer à renvoyer aux archivés la légende qu'à Alexandrie il n'y a rien à
                        voir, légende que, comme toutes les maldicenze, tont le monde répète sans se
                        donner la peine de la controler. Mr. Breccia remercie au nom de la Société
                        et de la Ville le profesrear Maspero, qui a bien voulu approuver mon projet
                        et mettre &amp; ma disposition la somme nécessaire. Nos fouilles ont été les
                        premières initiées sa Mariout qui d'ailleurs commence à devenir l'objet de
                        l'attention des archéologues. En effet, le Révérend Kaufmann a entrepris il
                        y a plusieurs mois de grandes fouilles à Karm. Abum, à une trentaine de
                        kilomètres à l'inté rieur en face d'Aboussir, fouilles ont donné de
                        splendides résultats. Nous avons raison de oroire que M. Kaufmann va inviter
                        blentôt la Société visiter ses trouvailles. Les fouilles de Taposiris qui
                        jaqa'ioi ont ooûté moins de trois mille fraños ont mis à jour une partie de
                        la ville, c'est-à-dire des maisons en admirable état de conservation aveo
                        toutes leurs annexes, des chapelles do mestiques, un, vaste système de
                        canalisation des routes, aré néoropole d'oiseaux momifiés, des tombeaux à
                        coupole, à puits, à. chambres. Parmi les objets il faut signaler des insorip
                        tions, quelques soulptures, quelques statuettes en terre cuite, des marques
                        en plâtre doré eto.. Aux ruines déjà découvertes, on ajouté la vae
                        magnifique du grand temple, de la tour du ignal et celle incomparable de la
                        mor et du paysage. On pourra no convaincre que l'exonr sión d'Abousir est
                        une excursion digne d'être Taite non seulement par les savants et par les
                        touristes, mais même par les Alexandrina qui par opetro yont chercher des
                        sensations: très loin de leur ville. D'ailleurs, l'amour pour les choses
                        mortes qu'on voudrait faire revivra n'est pas comme celui des femmes, jaloux
                        et égoïste. Il a le défaut contraire. Oelui qui en <cb n="6"/> a été pris
                        tâche de le faire partager par tout le monde, même par ceux qui voudraient
                        le con: sidérer comme an demi fou. Vous n'êtes pas dans cette catégorie,
                        mais en tout cas si l'ex- öursion ne vous a pas satisfait, n'en voulez pas
                        aux antiquités ni moi non plus.</p>
                    <p>After this discourse, had been delivered the pressor con lucted the party to
                        various interesting tombs, remains of houses, and other vestiges of the
                        ancient city: Only recently have excavations been made hare by the professor
                        and some important finds have resulted. Every thing tends to show that the
                        city was once of considerable importance, and a very large area is covered
                        with the vestiges of former habitations. The site is a very favourable one
                        for a town. The soil is dry and the situation lofty, on a range of hills
                        overlooking the sea, which on this part of the coast is of an extra-
                        ordinarily brilliant light blue colour owing to the reflection from the
                        limestone rocks beneath, Bemains of roads and canals have been dis covered
                        in the neighbourhood, and in the town itself the recent excavations have led
                        to considerable finds of mummied birds and fishes, etc.</p>
                    <p>After a peregrination round the ruins tea was partaken of and the party
                        reached Wardian again at 7p.m. The organisation of the exour hion was
                        perfect, and a great deal of trouble was neccesitated in catering for angha
                        large party: in, so out of the way a spot. The arrangements were in the
                        hands of Norsa Bey, Director, of the Receipts Department of the Alexandria
                        Municipality, and he is to be heartily congratulated on his complete success
                        in the arduous task entrusted to him.</p>

                        occurred to Miss Gould, was unremitting in his attentions and was warmly
                        thanked by the president of the society for his services.</p>

                    <p>I am sorry, anya a London correspondent, to hear that Mr. Wilfrid Blunt, who
                        has been in London of late, has been far from well. As one of those who
                        offered imprisonment in their: enthusiasm for Ireland, he should live to see
                        reality of better days for her. He must have ejoyed seeing the Liberal wave
                        sweep the big, busy towns of England at the last election-a double pleasure
                        to him; for, keen Radical that he has always been, he has been throughout
                        his life lover of the oitos of men and their manifest activities, more
                        perhaps than would generally be thought.by those who have known of him
                        chiefly from his interest in Bgypt and Arab horses, an interest which speaks
                        rather of deserts than of orowded streets.</p>

                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.
                        Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can
                        do, makes it pearly white, gives life to the tissues, elasticity to the
                        muscles, and a deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature's Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to
                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or
                        the effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot
                        climates are so fatal.</p>
