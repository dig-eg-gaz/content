                        <p>This celebrated water paint is made in two qualities for Inside and

                            all tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and
                            only requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is
                            quickly and easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour
                            and at one third the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures
                            cleanliness, and is pleasing to the eye. It appeals alike to artistic
                            and practical house decoration. HALL’S DISTEMPER is of special value in
                            hot climates. Owing to its cool, pleasing colours, great

                            that it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                    <head>CONSCRIPTION.</head>
                    <p>Lord Roberts’s outspoken utterances in the House of Lords yesterday during
                        the debate on National Defence will do much to hasten the approach of the
                        day when compulsory service will have to be adopted as the only solution of
                        the problem of the defence of our world-wide empire. Compulsory service must
                        sooner or later become inevitable. The Army, it is stated, is in the
                        melting-pot—a pot that has received such a stirring and shaking recently as
                        to have had much of its contents upset ; and from what remains it can
                        scarcely be hoped to mould that ideal, though limited, Army, which we are
                        told the Empire needs. Some new weighty metal will have to be added to
                        strengthen and steady the seething mass, and must either be bought dearly,
                        or demanded, free. One thing alone can make some sort of universal service a
                        necessity—lack of recruits, or even, with our large foreign garrison, lack
                        of suitable recruits. Men are now being enlisted for nine years with the
                        colours, and, so far, recruiting under this order has been satisfactory : in
                        fact, recently the War Office complacently published figures to prove this,
                        and to show that the decrease in numbers was of small moment—was a
                        necessity, in fact, to effect a saving in the Estimates, and possessed
                        advantage in that each man now enlisted is available for foreign service,
                        whereas a small percentage only of the short service men became eligible by
                        extending their service. Apart from the fact that the question of the
                        extension of short service men was a misleading comparison, seeing that for
                        some time past the War Office has, of necessity, been despatching drafts to
                        India composed wholly of three-years men who had not extended, the question
                        arises:—If, during the winter and a period of exceptional distress the
                        recruiting returns (under the long service system) showed a decided
                        decrease, what will happen now when a plenitude of labour, and summer, which
                        so greatly modifies the need for housing, clothing, and food, have returned
                        ? At such a time the Militia generally provides a sufficiently convenient
                        refuge for those in want of temporary subsistence. To subsequent intending
                        recruits the disadvantage of service that <cb n="6"/>will most weigh with
                        them, after the loss of freedom, will be service in India. Nothing
                        contributed more to the success of the short service system—from the
                        recruiting point of view only—than the tact that the recruit did not
                        anticipate service abroad in his three years. Nothing will exercise a
                        greater deterrent effect on recruiting than the prospect of serving eight
                        and a half years in the tropics. </p>
                    <p>Lack of prospect of employment on return to civil life is not the chief
                        recruiting deterrent to the extent supposed. The indigent recruit, in common
                        with the deliberate soldier, does not give this remote possibility too deep
                        thought. Very few soldiers give their future prospects consideration till
                        towards the end of their service, and often not until they finally go on
                        furlough pending discharge. It may have a small deterrent effect through the
                        agency of those ex-soldiers who have been unsuccessful in their quest for
                        employment but their testimony is not so convincing as the maladvertisement
                        of service abroad by ex soldiers who have been detained beyond their time in
                        India, are ruined in health, and thereby unable to earn a living. </p>
                    <p>Will the Government revert to short service when the long service system has
                        resulted in that decrease of establishment (with too great precipitation,
                        perhaps; which we were told was desirable ? Every experienced military
                        officer will pray not; since our recent experience has unquestionably proved
                        to what a great extent such a system resulted in a deterioration in quality
                        of personnel. But would the system meet with its former success ? Scarcely,
                        for these reasons : there is not now the stimulus of the South African War ;
                        and the great prudent recruiting class have learnt that, first, without
                        extension of service they are ineligible for service pay, and then only
                        after two years’ service, subject to restrictions ; secondly, that, in some
                        measure to make up for their short stay in the Army, they have to undergo
                        extra drills, and are not given staff billets ; and, finally, that short
                        service has been proved to be no guarantee against foreign service. There is
                        an increased reluctance on the part of the better-class section of the
                        community to enlist, due, perhaps, to the general improvement in wages, and
                        increased love of independence, and a progressive standard of comfort and
                        domesticity—the last two notable absentees from Army life—and to the fact
                        that, owing to the spread of education, the Army no longer offers an
                        attractive career of quick promotion to the moderately educated. The
                        corps—such as the Royal Engineers and Army Service Corps—which offer a
                        congenial prospect to skilled workers, clerks, are always well filled ; but
                        the infantry and cavalry gain precious few of these eminently desirable men. </p>
                    <p>However limited our army is to be, a very large force (about 112,000, now
                        that the Egyptian garrison has been reduced) is needed for garrisoning India
                        and the Colonies, and must be maintained by drafts from the home Army ;
                        whilst, as pointed out by Lord Roberts, Russia’s encroachment on the Indian
                        frontier places us in a position something similar to the great European
                        military Powers. When the recruits fail to come, the Army at home will be
                        depleted owing to the provision of drafts for the foreign battalions, to
                        vanishing point. What, then, will remain for defence at home in the event of
                        threatened invasion? A skeleton regular Army, with an increased obligation
                        to provide drafts for abroad ; a rapidly dwindling Volunteer force of
                        250,000, which is now threatened by a farther reduction of 50,000 ; the
                        Militia of 118,000 ; and the Reserve of 70,000, the greater part of whom
                        would be required for the battalions abroad. The quality of this Reserve,
                        formed so largely of short service men, is incomparably below that which
                        strengthened our Army daring the South African War. After the inadequate
                        tempering of the material in a fitful three years, what will be the value of
                        the article after eight or nine years’ disuse ? The rearmament of the
                        artillery, and issue to the infantry of the new short rifle will not render
                        this addition of numbers (scarcely strength) the more effective. The
                        available force, therefore, would scarcely suffice for the formation of
                        adequate offensive corps. And in that case the defence of towns and villages
                        must rest with the citizen. How far are we prepared for this contingency ?
                        The Boer system of military service was, within certain limits, ideal ; and
                        something of the sort was attempted on a small scale in Cape Colony by the
                        formation of Town Guards under self-elected officers. And during the
                        invasion of Cape Colony by the Boers excellent service was rendered by these
                        extempore soldiers. Some such system will eventually have to be established
                        in England. If all able-bodied men in each village or district were
                        enrolled, electing their own officers from among them, and divided into
                        established sections for the defence of certain points, a backbone of
                        undoubted rigidity and strength would be added to the defence of the
                        country. An initial training of some fourteen days or so under competent
                        regular instructors, and a subsequent three days annually, with the liberal
                        use of rifle ranges, should result in a useful irregular body at least
                        capable of adequately defending their own homes, thus enabling the standing
                        force to be employed elsewhere. The provision of ranges is, of course, the
                        chief difficulty ; but miniature ranges, on which the ordinary .303 ball
                        ammunition can be used, have been constructed at Hythe and Sheffield, and
                        have proved of great practical utility. Thus only might distasteful
                        conscription be obviated. </p>

                                Balfour’s statement of the 11th of May was severely criticised. Lord
                                Roberts said that the lessons of the South African war were already^
                                forgotten. He had no hesitation in saying that the army is as
                                absolutely unfitted and unprepared for war now as it was then. The
                                nation must choose between conscription and universal training.

                            <p>The country is suffering considerably this year from the high price
                                of cereals. Durrah and beans, which form the principal ingredient in
                                the diet of the fellah, have reached the price of P,T. 9 to 10 per
                                keila. In spite of the excellent barley crop in the Mariout
                                district, for which the abundant rains of last winter are
                                responsible, the price of barley has risen to from P.T. 63 to 65 per
                                ardeb, against an average of P.T. 45 per ardeb in 1904, when the
                                rain crop was to all intents and purposes non-existent The English
                                and Con­tinental breweries have bought up a very large proportion of
                                this year’s crop, and the barley from the rain belt is evidently in
                                as high request among brewers as ever. The present price of these
                                cereals makes the feeding of horses and cattle a very costly affair.
                                The bersim is over and the poorer owners of cattle and horses are
                                sometimes obliged to give their beasts half rations.</p>

                            <p>It is stated that the Land Bank of Egypt has announced that it will
                                issue no further loans on mortgages till the end of September. This
                                bank has already placed upwards of £1,300,000 on similar loans since
                                its founda­tion six months ago. The other mortgage-banks are only
                                accepting on an average about 5 per cent, of the transactions
                                proposed. The natural result of this action on their part is the
                                growth of a certain uneasiness among land-owners, who find great
                                difficulty in obtaining the money required for the exploitation of
                                their lands. The Agricultural Bank, of course, con­fines its

                        <head>BRITISH TRADE IN EGYPT. MR. FREEMAN’S REPORT.</head>
                        <p>In his report on the trade of Alexandria for 1904 Mr. Vice-Consul Freeman
                            remarks ;— The answer to the question why the United Kingdom is, or at
                            any rate seems to be, grad­ually losing the largest share in respect of
                            the total imports is perhaps to be found in the wonderfully prosperous
                            condition of the country.i, the greater attention that it consequently,
                            attracts among Continental manufacturers and merchants, and in the
                            keener desire aroused on 9 their part to enter so tempting a market. The
                            contributions of countries other than those specified in the table have
                            more than doubled in the space of four years. Postal parcels and the
                            various goods included under the heading of “Other imports” have
                            likewise doubled in four years. The expansion is spread over all
                            categories and almost all items, and the stock inquiry : “Where are
                            there openings for British trade ?” can best be answered with the one
                            word “everywhere.” But at the same time I can only repeat the 8took
                            advice to manufacturers, jointly or singly, to have agents on the spot
                            and to send more travellers. As the representative of a group of British
                            firms remarked to me, the native tastes may not change, the same class
                            of goods may be in demand for years, but nevertheless local requirements
                            should be studied at the outset, and regular, periodical visits are
                            necessary to ensure a hold on the market. The agents at Alexandria of a
                            British firm dealing in carpenters’ and blacksmiths’ tools and also in
                            Sheffield goods in general wrote to this Con­sulate as follows:—“The
                            difficulty with our principals arises from the fact that the native does
                            not use the same tools as the British workman. Many modifications and
                            additions have consequently to be made so as to adapt the tools to what
                            is required on our markets. If it were a question of a few articles
                            only, the difficulty could easily be overcome by sending home samples ;
                            but as there are a thousand and probably more lines that have to be
                            attended to you will easily understand how impossible it is for an agent
                            who is neither a carpenter nor a blacksmith to give them all the
                            particulars they want. We there­fore suggested that they should send out
                            either one of the partners in their firm or a competent traveller, who,
                            with our help, might secure the first orders. What we have to complain
                            of most in the firms at home is that, although oar markets are invaded
                            by an army 'of foreign travellers, they (the British firms) do not take
                            the trouble or care to incur the expense of sending out competent men to
                            see What others are doing. We may give you as an instance the case of
                            Messrs whose turnover with us was very small until they decided to send
                            out one of the partners of the firm. They are now doing many more
                            thousands than they did hundreds.”</p>
                        <p>Another British commercial traveller told me that his quotation for
                            certain goods was 18s. per cwt. (If. 16s. per 100 kilos.) with three
                            months’ credit, while the German quotation, thanks partly to the
                            drawback in Germany, was 25 fr. (1/.) per 100 kilos., with six months’
                            credit. The British article was of course better, and some people
                            preferred it, but it was not, as the priced would seem to show, worth
                            nearly twice as much as the German article. With such competition as
                            this to face, merchandise, however excellent in itself, can scarcely be
                            left to speak for itself with any prospect of success. I hear of
                            machinery being bought in the United Kingdom by German firms and sold at
                            Alex­andria more cheaply than if it were imported direct. Here again
                            there is surely scope for the energies of a British traveller.</p>
                        <p>Inquiries of all kinds are received at this Consulate in ever increasing
                            numbers, and it is becoming almost impossible to answer them all. The
                            prospects and possibilities of this trade and of that trader the
                            restrictions and regulations to which they are subject, a description of
                            the articles already in the market, —such inquiries cannot be usefully
                            answered except after long and careful study of the conditions affecting
                            each particular trade, and this study a Consul has no time to
                            undertake.</p>

                            next are almost completed. A large and well-decorated triumphal arch has
                            been erected at the Boulac entrance of the Esbekieh Gardens, and this
                            will be illuminated on the night of the 14th. A wooden pavilion has been
                            erected in the gardens for the official receptions and a stage has also
                            b3en erected for a variety entertainment which will be given by the
                            troupe of the “Nouveautés.” The gardens are gaily decorated with flags
                            and promise to look most effective when lit up by the numerous Chinese
                            lanterns and electric globes which are hung in every direction. The

                            will perform alternately throughout the even­ing, and there will also be

                        <p>The weather is becoming more oppressive than ever, owing to the hot
                            khamseen winds. Fever is daily on the increase, both among the natives
                            and Europeans, especially among the railway people. The latest victim in
                            hospital is Mr. W. H. Bailey, Inspector of Bridges, Suakin-Atbara Line,
                            who is, however, pro­gressing favorably towards recovery.</p>
                        <p>The following passengers are leaving by the S.S. Dakahlieh to-day, viz.,
                            Mr. Smart, chief storekeeper, Suakin Railway, who is being invalided
                            home to England, Mr. Fulton and Mr. Finlay, also of the Suakin-Atbara
                            Rail­ways, who are likewise returning to England invalided as unfit for

                        <head>EGYPTIAN LAND AND GENERAL TRUST.</head>
                        <p>The report of the Egyptian Land and General Trust, Ltd., submitted to the
                            statutory meeting on the 6th instant, states that with a view to
                            spreading the company’s investments over as wide a field as possible,
                            the directors are acquiring a large building area in the heart of Cairo,
                            and their agent-general in Egypt, Mr. Hooker, who has recently been to
                            London to confer with the board, has just left for Egypt to complete the
                            arrangements, subject to the titles of the property proving
                            satisfactory. If this business is concluded the directors have no
                            hesitation in saying that it will be a most satis­factory investment for
                            the company. The direc­tors are also on the point of completing the
                            purchase of some very valuable budding land in Alexandria which has been
                            strongly recommended to them by their local advisers. The directors feel
                            that when these transactions are concluded the shareholders will have a
                            considerable interest in the heart of the two most important cities in
                            Egypt—namely, Cairo and Alexandria, which cannot fail to give most
                            satisfactory results. In view of the growing importance of the Egyptian
                            Mining industry, the directors are supporting on favorable terms the
                            issue of the Egyptian Gold and Emerald Company, Ltd. In this they are
                            acting in conjunction with the United African Explo­rations, Ltd. The
                            Egyptian Gold and Emerald Company, Ltd., is formed to acquire what
                            appears to be one of the most important mineral concessions in Egypt The
                            concession comprises an area of some 3,000 square miles, and it is
                            reported upon by responsible engineers as being rich in gold, silver,
                            lead, copper and emerald mines. The directors have also before them
                            various proposals, which are-likely to materialise shortly, for the
                            development of sound and profitable business in other direc­tions. The
                            Board have elected Mr. Charles H. Rigg as a director to represent his
                            substantial financial interest in the company.</p>

                        <p>Sir,—I should be greatly obliged if you would, through your columns, call
                            the atten­tion of the Cairo police to another street nuisance which
                            exists. At most of the junctions of two streets cabstands exist, and the
                            cabmen appear to think that they have a right to stand in such a manner
                            that the passage of pede­strians is entirely obstructed. The cabmen
                            naturally wish to look for fares along both roads, and draw up their
                            cabs accordingly, the general public have to go round them in the middle
                            of the road, which has pos­sibly been recently watered. The stand
                            opposite the Cafe Chicha is perhaps one of the worst cases in point
                            There is always a policeman on duty at this place, but he does nothing
                            to ameliorate the nuisance, and when complained to it is with the
                            greatest difficulty that one can drive into his head that the cabman is
                            in any way out of order. Personally, I invariably insist on the cab
                            being removed. Sometimes I am met with abuse or stolid resistance, but,
                            being fluent in the language, I finally get my way. Frequently the
                            cabman returns to his former position immediately I have passed, and
                            remains there. It surely would be an easy matter to explain to the
                            policemen, either individually or collectively when on parade, the
                            rights of pedestrians, or simpler still, to pat a red paint mark on the
                            footpath indicating the limits of the cabstand. Apologising for
                            troubling you,—I am, etc.,</p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,—At the hotels in Egypt collecting cards for the S. P. C. A. are
                            in evidence for support, bat at Port Said at least they are not likely
                            to get much as long as the dis­gusting scenes occur while cattle are
                            being landed. The poor beasts are slung by the feet or horns, kept for
                            hours without water, most likely from the port at which they embark, and
                            on landing try to drink from the sea.</p>
                        <p>On Tuesday the passengers on a ship in quarantine (therefore unable to
                            take steps) were entertained by the following exhibition of cruelty. A
                            cow ran away from the herd and was chased out on the breakwater by three
                            or four savages, her tail was twisted, she was stoned on the head and
                            body with rocks of about 20 lbs., beaten unmercifully with battens 3
                            inches thick, sticks were thrust into her anus and vagina, she was
                            thrown off the breakwater into the sea, a fall of 12 feet, dragged over
                            the rocks that cut her hide, hauled up again in a most brutal fashion,
                            her horns torn off and blood was streaming from her nostrils. This
                            performance took about two hours. We are used to seeing acts of cruelty,
                            but not such refined brutality as this. If the S. P. C. A. has a
                            representative, he should be on the spot where these things happen or
                            else he is not much use.—I am, etc.,</p>

                    <p>Encore sous l’influence de la liquidation de fin du mois, notre marché a
                        débuté calme et insignifiant On s’attendait même à ce que cet état de
                        marasme durut toute la semaine, lorsque l’heureuse issue des négociations
                        franco-allemandes et la nomination définitive de ministres plénipotentiaires
                        russo-japonais en vue de la paix ont remis à flot les bourses européennes ;
                        ce qui a été d’autant plus facile que le capital abonde en Europe.</p>
                    <p>A tons ces motifs de hausse est encore venu s’ajouter un facteur important:
                        la reprise soudaine et considérable des cotons à la suite du rapport du
                        Bureau d’Agriculture de Washington sur les prévisions de la prochaine
                        récolte. Sur notre place, pourtant, la spéculation continue à négliger les
                        sociétés nouvelles pour concentrer toute son attention sur les anciennes,
                        dites à tranche dorée. On a pu remarquer cette tendance chez un grand nombre
                        de maisons financières de notre ville qui estiment sans doute que ces
                        valeurs ont été trop dépréciées à l’occasion des derniers lancements de
                        compagnies.</p>
                    <p>La valeur qui a donné lieu au plus fort mouvement est l’Agricole en raison de
                        l’ouverture de la souscription des nouveaux titres à partir du 10 juillet
                        jusqu’au 2 octobre. Ce fait a de suite attiré des acheteurs. Certains
                        spéculateurs même, pensant que les nouveaux titres ne seraient livrés qu’au
                        2 octobre, c’est-à dire avec un trimestre de crédit, eurent bientôt fait de
                        les pousser jusqu’à 9 13/16, tandis que l’ancienne émission ne dépassait pas
                        13 7/8 ; mais, à peine surent-ils que des certificats provisoires au porteur
                        seraient mis en circulation dans un délai maximum d’un mois, qu’ils
                        devinrent plus réservés : la nouvelle émission baissait du coup d’un quart
                        de livre, tandis que l’ancienne avec droit montait de 1/16 à 1/8. L’ancienne
                        avait débuté à 13 9/16 et touché un moment 14 1/16, elle clôture à 1315/16;
                        la nouvelle finit à 9 9/16.</p>
                    <p>La Fondateur Agricole débute à 912 pour clôturer à 960 acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>Tout-à-fait calme d’abord à 28, la Daïra monte graduellement jusqu'à 28 1/2,
                        pour réactionner aujourd’hui à 28 e/8. L’assemblée du Crédit Foncier
                        Egyptien réunie au Caire samedi pour la liquidation de la Daïra a décidé,
                        paraît-il, de payer à celle-ci la somme de</p>

                        actionnaires, la Daïra Sanieh s’engage à les prendre. On ne peut rien dire
                        encore de définitif concernant la liquidation de cette société vu qu'elle a
                        encore diverses affaires à régler. </p>
                    <p>De 26, au début la National Bank fléchit à 25 29/32 pour reprendre, peu à peu
                        à 26 3/8 par suite de la hausse sur l’Agricole à laquelle la National est,
                        comme on le sait, fort intéressée. La clôture a lieu à ce prix. Comme
                        c’était à prévoir, l’écart entre l’ancienne et la nouvelle émission au
                        profit de cette dernière est tombé de 1/4 à 5,32 de £. On ne tardera pas à
                        voir ce rapprochement s’accentuer et l'ancienne reprendre même le dessus. </p>
                    <p>La Land Bank ouvre à 9 pour clôturer très ferme et en bonne tendance à 9 3/8. </p>
                    <p>A 807 à l’ouverture les actions Foncier fléchissent un moment à 805, pour

                        le cours monte de 156 à 158, retombe à 156 par suite d’une concession
                        accordée à une Compagmie d’automobiles sur la route de Ramleh, et reprend ce

                    <p>La Salt &amp; Soda a été plutôt délaissée entre 34 et 34/6. La clôture a lieu

                    <p>De 2 1/4 la Delta Land monte à 2 7/16, prix auquel elle est très demandée. </p>
                    <p>L’Anglo-American Nile et le groupe des Hôtels ont été en grande faveur durant
                        la semaine écoulée. L’Anglo-American Nile, grâce aux prévisions pour la

                    <p>Complètement délaissée au début à 27/, la New Egyptian Co hausse rapidement à
                        35/6 à la nouvelle d’un dividende de 12 %. </p>

                    <p>La Khédivial Mail tombe sans raison apparente de 4 5/16 à 4 1/8. Les affaires
                        ont d'ailleurs été très clairsemées. </p>
                    <p>Les Estâtes gagnent 1/16 et remontent de 27/32 à 29/32. </p>
                    <p>Somme toute, le marché se présente sous un bon aspect et si l’on en finissait
                        avec les complications politiques et l’état troublé de la Russie il se
                        pourrait fort bien que nous eussions une saison d’été aussi animée que

                    <p>Cotons.—Après un peu d’hésitation, le marché s'est décidément calmé, et la
                        clôture a été faible et en baisse. Au fond pourtant on penche toujours pour
                        la hausse et si l'Amérique nous vient en aide ce soir une reprise est plus
                        que probable pour demain. Ceci pour le novembre ; quant au juillet il est
                        dans un abandon complet et les grosses exportations n’ont pas même pu le
                        ranimer. </p>
                    <p>Graines de coton.—La petite spéculation se montrant constamment anxieuse de
                        réaliser, cela affaiblit le marché et le fait baisser. Marché peu actif
                        aujourd’hui. </p>
                    <p>Fèves.—Cours nominaux et en baisse à cause du disponible. </p>
