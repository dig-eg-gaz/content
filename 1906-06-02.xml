                    <head>THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY.</head>
                    <p>The revival of interest in the Baghdad Rail way scheme with the rumours of an
                        Anglo- Russian understanding have evoked consider able discussion in the
                        home Press. The, "Morning Post's" correspondent at Berlin? writes that ho is
                        assured from an official sourde that there is no truth in the rumours which
                        are circulating in generally well-informed circles that negotiations are
                        afoot with the object of effecting a reversal of the decision formed by Mr
                        Balfour's Cabinet three years ago to refrain from encouraging the participa-
                        tion of British capital in the Baghdad Railway. Germany, he is informed, has
                        certainly made no fresh overtures and Sir Edward Grey, to judge by his
                        recant statement in the House of Commons, does not contemplate taking any
                        initiative in this question. </p>
                    <p>The circumstance has not been forgotten in Berlin that, according to reports
                        authenti- cated at the time, both Mr. Balfour and the Marquis of Lansdowne
                        were personally in favour of the association of British capital in the
                        German enterprise. Those statesmen were, however, out-voted by their
                        colleagues, who are supposed to have been influenced by the anti- German
                        articles of two prominent London journals. This being so, it has always been
                        felt in authoritative circles in Germany that the future might bring about a
                        revocation or a modification of the negative attitude adopted by the Balfour
                        Cabinet. That time, however, <cb n="6"/>in the opinion of the German
                        Government, has not yet arrived. </p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the belief is widespread in Berlin that German diplomacy is
                        planning to improve its position as regards the prospects of the Baghdad
                        Railway and also of trade generally in Central and Western Asia by taking a
                        hand in the struggle for influence in Persia. The policy of Germany hitherto
                        has been practically one of abstention from all diplomatic activity in the
                        Dominions of the Shah, bat there are now several indications, including the
                        recent appoint- ment of her new and remarkably able Minister to Teheran and
                        the establishment of a steamship service to the Persian Gulf, that she is
                        preparing to abandon this attitude and to make her influence felt in those
                        regions. That she would proclaim her fresh departure by negotiating for the
                        cession of a coaling station in the Persian Golf, as is reported from Paris,
                        is, however, entirely unlikely. indeed, the statements issued on this
                        subject from the French capital and published in London are described as a
                        mare's- rest </p>
                    <p>The scheme is very thoroughly dealt with in the latest number of "The
                        Spectator." Our contemporary thinks that in all probability we shall
                        immediately be asked to prove the since- rity of our desire to be on good
                        terms with Germany, and to establish a better understand- ing with her
                        Government The test proposed will be our assent to the Baghdad Railway. n
                        our opinion (says the "Spectator") our Govern- ment should most certainly
                        do. nothing to oppose the making of that railway. We say now in the most
                        absolute terms, as we said when the scheme was mooted some four years ago,
                        that no railway can be laid on any part of the world's surface without
                        benefit to Britain. Britain, as the greatest of trading nations, most be the
                        better for more railways. Most foolishly, we attempted to prevent the
                        cutting of the Suez Canal ; bat the Suez Canal was out, and proved of
                        immense material benefit to Britain. In the same way, if the Baghdad Railway
                        is made, it is certain to carry large quantities of British goods, and so to
                        benefit British trade. Clearly, then, no obstacles should be placed by
                        us—and we are convinced that none will be placed by us—in the way of the
                        Baghdad Railway. When, however, as we expect will prove to be the case, we
                        are not merely asked to refrain from throwing obstacles in the way of the
                        railway, but are asked as a Government to sanction and patronise that
                        railway officially, a very different question arises. What we objected to on
                        the former occasion, and what we feel obliged to object to now, is the
                        proposition that the name of the British Government should be placed, as it
                        were, upon the prospectus of the Baghdad Railway, and that British investors
                        should be asked to put their money into the scheme under the encouragement
                        or moral guarantee of our Government That proposition is a very differ- ent
                        matter, and seems to us one open to the very gravest objection. </p>
                    <p>Now, however, we are in effect told that we shall be guilty of an unfriendly
                        act towards Germany if we do not change our practice in this respect, and,
                        as we have said, allow the name of the British Government to be placed upon
                        the prospectus of the Baghdad Railway. We cannot give the investor the
                        right, if the railway fails as a speculation, to turn upon the British
                        Government and say : "Yon gave us a moral guarantee for the investment of
                        our money." Again, if the question of the Indian mail subsidies is raised,
                        we do not think that the British Government ought to go further than to say
                        that if, when the rail- way is built, it can be shown that three or four
                        days can be saved by sending the mails by the Baghdad Railway, then no doubt
                        we shall send them by that route, provided, of course, that the railway will
                        give os reasonable terms. British mails must travel by the quickest route,
                        granted that those who control the quickest route do not make "their terms
                        too onerous. </p>
                    <p>The promoters of the Baghdad Railway should carry out their railway by an
                        honest and straightforward appeal to the investors of the world, and not by
                        any elaborate diplo- matic or financial hocus-pocus. There is plenty of
                        money in Germany, in England, and in France for any and every sound
                        commercial project. If a project is not reasonably sound commercially, it is
                        better that the world should hear no more of it. Our hope, however, is hat
                        the promoters of the Baghdad Railway, abandoning all diplomatic and
                        financial finesse, will be able to get their money in the open market and
                        build their railway . If they do, we have no doubt that British trade and
                        commerce, in conjunction with the trade and commerce of the rest of the
                        world, will im- mensely benefit thereby.</p>

                    <p>To-morrow being the Italian national fete of the "Statute," the Marquis

                    <p>Sale of Shoonah.</p>
                    <p>The Bavarian royal University of Munich has just sold, on advantageous
                        conditions, to the Society Anonyme des Presses Libres Egyptiennes, a large
                        shoonah which it pos- sessed at Minet-et-Bassal, Alexandria. It has also
                        leased to the same company for 10 years an open space of ground of 2,106
                        square metres. </p>
                    <p>Hashish Smuggling.</p>
                    <p>The Coast Guard Administration confiscated yesterday a quality of hashish
                        which a native boatman was attempting to smuggle though fate No. 6 on the
                        Marina. The boatman was arrested. A Frenchman and another native were also
                        attempting to smuggle a quantity of hashish yesterday when they were
                        discover- ed by a coastguard in the Customs quarter.</p>
                    <p>Provincial Crime.</p>
                    <p>A gang of robbers has appeared at Ashmoun and is reported to have committed
                        several brutal assaults. Another gang attacked a house at Al Gedided on the
                        27th inst. A scuffle ensued, and a native named Mahmoud Ibrahim Attia was
                        killed. The murderer, Mahran Ali Said by name, was arrested by the other
                        memebers of the gang and an enquiry opened by the police. </p>
                    <p>Mikado and Islam.</p>
                    <p>The rumor of the conversion of the Emperor of Japan to Islam has been revived
                        by the native Press. A Tartar newspaper published in the Caucasus is
                        responsible for the state- ment. "Al Lewa" remarks: "If the news is
                        unconfirmed to-day there is nothing against its confirmation in the near
                        future. Why should the Emperor Mutsohito not share the views of Napoleon I.,
                        the Great Emperor of the French ?"</p>
                    <p>Mohamed Zeki, el Din Seued, on of the ulema, writes to "Al Lewa" on this
                        subject, offering to go to preach Islam to the Japanese provided that good
                        food, accommodation, etc., are guaranteed him !</p>

                    <head>THE PILGRIMAGE</head>
                    <p>EMIR EJ HAJ's REPORT</p>
                    <p>According to a "Times" correspondent, the report of the Emir el Haj, Lewa
                        Ibra- him Fathy Pacha, is highly satisfactory from every point of view, and
                        bears ample testimony to the wisdom of the measures taken this year to
                        safeguard the lives and property of Egyptian pilgrims from the lawless
                        Bedouins of the Hed- jaz. The Jeddah-Mecca pilgrim road was well guarded
                        this year by Turkish troops, only a few petty thefts being reported. Arafat,
                        where pilgrims had been robbed and murdered in previous years, was held by a
                        post of Ottoman regulars and Zaptiehs and was in consequence perfectly safe,
                        and the Bedouins of this part of the Hedjaz, two tribes of whom has indulged
                        in a regular engagement within sight of the headquarters of the Bali of the
                        Hedjaz in 1904, had been cowed by the public execution at Mecca of several
                        notorious brigands by the orders of Ali Pacha, the new Sherif of Mecca.
                        Medina appears to have been quiet, but its Governor, fearing an attack by
                        the Beni Harb should the escort take the Darb el Sultani (the Sultan's
                        road), ordered it to follow another route known as the "Tarik el Tarif," on
                        which little water was to be found, and which took four more days to
                        traverse owing to the broken and rocky nature of the country. Dear Yambo el
                        Nakhl there was some trouble with the Beni Ibrahim and El Sefkafah Bedouins,
                        who has arrived too late to receive their share of the customary presents
                        distributed to the chiefs of those tribes. But the pilgrims and escort
                        reached Tambo safely, and of the 3,000 persons who accompanied the Mahman,
                        soldiers and civilian members of the escort, pilgrims and camel drivers, not
                        one fell a victim to the Bedouins. As far as one can judge from the report
                        of the Emir el Haj, the increase of the Turkish garrisons in the Hedjaz and
                        the vigour of the new Sherif have rendered the Bedouins who live between the
                        coast and Arafat comparatively submissive. If the tribes in the Medina
                        district are more restless, their days of brigandage are none the less
                        numbered. The steady advance of the Hedjaz Railway, which is now, accord-
                        ing to the latest news from Syria, being once more pushed rapidly towards
                        Tebouk, brings with it the Turkish regular soldier and the Kurd, or
                        Circassian Zaptieh, before whom the Bedouin has given way in Syria and
                        Patraea. Elusive and wily as they are, the Bedouins of North Arabia and
                        Syria are incapable of con- ducting or resisting an attack with any
                        resolution- ion, and, though the Emir el Has reports that the Hedjaz tribes,
                        who 15 years ago possessed no better fire-arms than long matchlocks and
                        flint-lock muskets, are now armed to the extent of 50 per cent of their
                        number with breechloaders, Mausers, and Martini Henrys for the most part,
                        there is no reason to credit them with more military qualities than their
                        northern kindred.</p>

                    <p>ARTICLE BY MUSTAPHA PACHA KAMEL.</p>
                    <p>"Al Lewa" publishes the following as a leading article by Mustapha Pacha
                        Kamel :- The European press has been dwelling during the last few days on
                        the topic of Pan- Islamism, but many papers strayed from the path of
                        accuracy when referring to the question- ion as if Pan-Islamism aimed at
                        stirring ip Mohamedans against Christians, and bringing back such religious
                        wars as those which in the past inflicted such disasters on the human race
                        and did such serious harm to its civilisa- tion and prosperity. Such
                        statements come only from the ignorant or fanatical whose object is to
                        excite the European nations against Mohamedans. If Moslems sympathise with
                        each other and require progress fro their com- unities and states, rejoicing
                        at every laudable action that elevates their government and glorifies there
                        Caliphate, they do not intend to upset the world, nor that the Moslems
                        should stand together against the Christians: their ideal is an advance in
                        prosperity, and a growth in civilisation, such as was attained by their
                        forefathers and such as is now attained by the nations of Europe, America,
                        and Japan. Had these Western writers been animated by a true and earnest
                        love for the human race, to see the world enjoying progressive civilisation
                        and propensity; if they had really desired this (as they claim) they would
                        have been fain to welcome Pan-Islamism, which may enlighten three hundreds
                        millions of men or give renewed life to one of the most vital and powerful
                        members of the human body, and rect one of the most important pillars of the
                        world. Some false prophets have taken upon themselves to point out that
                        Pan-Islamism is dangerous to Moslems, and the Islam should not be mentioned
                        except in religious matters. But they appear to have failed to realize that
                        Islam teaches men, not only their religious cities, but how to seek
                        prosperity and make the best use of their lives. Consequently it is
                        impossible for a Mohamedan nation to advance from stage to stage of progress
                        with- out being guided by the teachings of Islam. There is no reason why the
                        rise and advance of the Mohamedan nations should not be effected by the same
                        causes as those which caused their fall; and, such being the case, the wise
                        man who advises the Egyptian people of the remedies necessary for their
                        well-being can address his advice equally well to any other Moslem nation;
                        since what appears to be use- ful to us is also useful to them. No wonder,
                        then, if the Moslem nations of the world have the same sympathies and the
                        same goal. </p>
                    <p>The enemies of Islam look with jealous eyes at all those Moslem peoples
                        because of the great interest they take in the welfare of the Ottoman
                        Government, with which they sum- pathise; but had they been in our position
                        they would have not hesitated to follow our example. It is a matter of fact
                        that every Moslem nation that loses its independence and falls in the hands
                        of a European Power consoles itself by the existence of the Ottoman
                        Government, which has taken on itself the duty of raising the Mohamedan
                        faith, and to care and protect all Moslems who are everywhere attached to
                        the Caliphate. </p>
                    <p>As for the Egyptians, there are many ties that bind them to the Ottoman
                        Government; and in spite of the genuine patriotism and warm desire to
                        maintain the independence of their country and secure self-government, they
                        consider their country to be as much a part of the Ottoman Empire as Canada
                        and Australia are of the British Empire. The local patriotism of the
                        Egyptians would by no means prevent their having sincere sympathy and
                        goodwill for their mother government. Pan- Islamism, consequently, is an
                        essential bond of the Mohamedan peoples, especially the Egyp- trans; and
                        those who look upon it as a dangerous policy are only attacking humanity
                        with weapons of falsehood. The object of our aspiration is prosperity and
                        upward progress, and we are waging no war except against ignorance and
                        backwardness.</p>

                    <head>PORT SAID.</head>
                    <p>THE HARBOUR IMPROVEMENTS.</p>
                    <p>In his report on the trade of Port Said and Suez in 1905, Mr. Consul-General
                        Cameron makes the following references to the con- templated improvements at
                        Port Said :- With the opening of the ordinary-gauge Government Railway on
                        June 1, 1904, a new era of prosperity has begun for Port said. The journey
                        to Cairo has been shortened to five hours, and the number of daily trains
                        has been increased both for goods and passengers, thus enabling the town to
                        cope with the demands of traffic in connection with the thousands of
                        tourists who pass through Port Said in the winter. A large tract of land has
                        been recovered from Lake Menzaleh, and em- bankments have been made for the
                        permanent station and depots. </p>
                    <p>During the next five years the barbour will have increased to more than twice
                        its present area. Au extensive basin is being dredged on the eastern side of
                        the Canal for the use of colliers and petroleum ships. When this is
                        completed the Abbas basin (on the western side, now occupied by the
                        colliers) will be available from vessels to load or discharge general cargo
                        in connection with the interior of Egypt. At the same times, the Bassin
                        Cherif on the western side is being doubles in size and deepened to 30 ft.,
                        and wharves and warehouses will be constructed without delay. </p>
                    <p>The Suez Canal Company's workshops will be removed to the eastern side of the
                        harbor, where accommodation will be made for a new village for European
                        andArabe workmen, and the tract of land at present occupied by the workshops
                        will be dredged away and deepened, making a new large basin of the arsenal,
                        with wharves reaching up to the railway station. The Menzaleh Canal and
                        Navigation Com- pany have dredged a deep and wide channel across the shallow
                        water of the lake, and established a service of ferry boats between Port
                        Said (Karpooty) and Matarieh, the eastern point of the fertile province of
                        Man- souah (Dakahlieh). The voyage would take about three hours, and, in
                        co0operation with the light railway of the Society Anonyme des Chemins de
                        Fer de la Basse Egypte, this route across the lake ought to prove of the
                        greatest value in connecting Port Said with the north of the delta. It is
                        poropseed to continue this channel as far as the station, and ultimately to
                        connect it with a lock into the maritime canal, the present sweet-water
                        canal passing under the channel by means of a syphon. </p>
                    <p>Another most important improvement now under consideration for contract is
                        the renewal of the older eastern breakwater and its conti- nuation towards
                        the western breakwater, so as to protect the shipping in harbour during the
                        gales in winter. </p>
                    <p>Substantial progress is being made in nearly all these items above mentioned,
                        and there is no doubt that within the next few years the commercial area of
                        this harbour will have been doubled.</p>

                    <p>To the editor of the "Egyptian Gazette." Dear Sir, - A "Daily Telegraph"
                        correspon- dance from Washington is reproduced in your yesterday's issue
                        stating that Abdul Hamid has been left up to this day in ignorance of the
                        death of President McKinley because no one dare inform him of the
                        assassination of the latter. </p>
                    <p>It is quite true that any news of this kind comes as a terrible shock to
                        abdul Hamid, who himself lives in perpetual terror of violent death, and has
                        even shaped all his internal policy under the influence of this mono-
                        maniacal idea. But to say that he does not know that McKinley fell a victim
                        to Anar- schism is manifestly absurd. We might as well be told that he has
                        been kept in the dark concerning the fate of Pres. Carnot, king Umberto, and
                        the Empress Elisabeth, and that he believes he is still dealing with their
                        predecessors. </p>
                    <p>So far from it bing the case that his entourage fine it advisable to deceive
                        him in connection with such events, admitting this to be possible, is not
                        Abdul Hamid in personal communication with the Ambassa- fors accréditiez to
                        his Court, who converse with him through their own interpreters ? Not a
                        minute is wasted by the responsible official in communicating the evil
                        tidings. Woe betide him if there is any loss of time. It is not generally
                        known that Abdul Hamid sees in every attempt on the life of a ruler a source
                        from which to draw new inspiration for the preservation of his own life
                        against the expected attacks of the regicide. I would add that the only
                        books his 'lecteur' has orders to read to him are detective stories
                        specially translated for him or composed by one of his courtiers on the
                        basis of data provided by his Majesty himself. - Yours faithfully, </p>

                        heard about an agitation in Ireland to discourage recruit- ing for the Army,
                        and if I remember rightly one or two persons were prosecuted for pub-
                        lishing false and malicious statements regard- ing the Army. I doubt,
                        however, whether the wildest abuse of the bitterest anti-English agitators
                        would do the Army anything like so much harm as the following letter which
                        was addressed to the Clerk of Kilkenny Guar- dians :- </p>
                    <p>Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley </p>
                    <p>April 30th, 1906. </p>
                    <p>Sir, - I am directed to inform you that No. 18005, Staff-Sergeant-Major James
                        Maher Hoynel, late Army Service Corps, a helpless discharged soldier, will
                        be sent to the care of the union authorities, Kilkenny, on tuesday rect, the
                        8th pros. He was born in the parish of St. Mary, Kilkenny; enlisted for the
                        Army at the Curragh Camp on October 2nd, 188. Will you kindly inform me as
                        early as possible the name of the nearest railway station to the union ? </p>
                    <p>I am, Sir, </p>
                    <p>Your obedient Servant, </p>
                    <p>GEORGE A. SIMMS, </p>
                    <p>Lieut.-Col. R.A.M.C. </p>
                    <p>"The letter was discussed at the last meeting of the Guardians, and they
                        passed a resolution refusing to receive Hoyne in the workhouse on the ground
                        that the War Office ought to make some better provision for him. With this
                        everybody outside the War Office will agree. Here is a soldier who has
                        served his country for twenty one years - served so well that he has risen
                        to the rank of Staff-Sergeant- Major. He is now a helpless invalid, and so
                        his grateful country, as mis-represented by military officialfdom, proposes
                        to pack him off to the workhouse of his native parish. Presumably the man is
                        entitled to a pension, and surely a place could be found for him in some
                        hospital or home for old soldiers."</p>

                        <p>After the explosion, King Alfonso stood up as if to protect Princess Ena.
                            He smilingly sainted the alarmed public, and assisted the Princess to
                            alight. The bomb, which was of polished steel, burst in the air, killing
                            two aristocratic occupants of a balcony. The people, were infuriated,
                            threatening tc lynch foreigners. A Catalan named Manne Duran has been
                            arrested, and is believed to be the author of the outrage. Another
                            acount describes an Italian, who escaped. (Reuter) </p>

                            five spectators were killed, and a hundred people injured including
                            General Weyler, whose condition is serious. Princess Ena is indisposed.
                            The festivi- ties continue. Twenty arrests have been made, but it is
                            believed that the actual perpetrator has so far escaped, although he is
                            known. King Alfonso and his Ministers will attend the funeral of the
                            victims. </p>

                            side, delirious with enthusiasm. t Five of the persons injured by the
                            explosion died to-day. </p>
                        <p>There are indications that the outrage was hatched by Anarchists in
                            London, and the most active investigations are being made there.

                    <head>ARCHITECTURE AND PROGRESS</head>
                    <p>MR. WILLIAM'S LECTURE.</p>
                    <p>(Continued from Wednesday.) </p>
                    <p>In some articles which, last December, I had the honor of contributing to the
                        "Gazette" mention was made of the division of Architecture into two broad
                        classes, namely, the organic and inorganic. I was told by a scholastic
                        friend that those articles were rather too technical - and il- lustration of
                        the difficulty under which we achi- tests suffer. Therms fail us. Our shop
                        and studio phrases have become common-places in our mouths and it is with
                        difficulty that we can find each other and more general terms. Mr. Reginald
                        Blomfield, the well-known archi- textural writer, in the preface to his
                        interesting "Studies in Architecture", mentions such diffi- cuties, stating
                        that "the result has been that architecture, considered as an art, had
                        dropped out of the main stream of educated thought," but he adds:- "After
                        all the vital interest of architecture is the human interest," with which we
                        cannot but agree, but while we agree we are bound to admit, that if anything
                        of human interest has dropped out of the "stream of educated thought." </p>
                    <p>That this one point should be architecture is as strange as it is true. There
                        never was a time when the great architectural works of Egypt, of Greece, of
                        Rome, of Europe, and the world generally were so much viewed as at present;
                        never before were these works so be-photographed, drawn, and illustrated;
                        never were handbooks and guidebooks to the architectural glories of the
                        world so plentiful, and never were facilities of access to and for study of
                        these buildings so easy an so much availed of as at the present time. To
                        proceed with our two classes of archi- lecture. The inorganic form of
                        architecture means, simply, the posing of masses of materials one upon
                        another, the stability of the resultant structure depending upon sheer
                        weight and mass alone. A pyramid is a simple form, and two columns
                        supporting a beam is a more complex form of inorganic building. All build-
                        ings in some measure partake of both forms, but broadly and generally the
                        Egyptian and Greek styles are inorganic. </p>
                    <p>The other form, the organic, is distinguished by the arch. The Egyptians used
                        the arch when constructing in brick, but neither they nor the Greeks, who
                        followed them, developed this form of architecture. It was left to the
                        Etruscans and the Romans to carry on this development. These famous builders
                        seized upon the arch and developed it in a masterly fashion. They discovered
                        the means of orga- rising material. With black of comparatively small size,
                        brick or aggregate of concrete, they spanned spaces which far exceeded those
                        covered by the great stone slabs of the Egyp- trans. Under the hands of the
                        Byzantine buil- dress this form of building was developed still further and
                        in the 13th and 14th centuries the Gothic builder brought it to a state of
                        perfection. The short definition then would run: Columns and beams are
                        inorganic; ar- ches and domes are organic. </p>
                    <p>Now let us for a moment consider the inor- ganic architecture of the Greeks.
                        In the hands of the Greek master masons, the trabeated, or column and beam,
                        or inorganic architec- sure, was brought to perfection. The columns were
                        beautiful in form and proportion and became the main feature. As it left the
                        chisel of these wonderful masons, the column became too beautiful to be
                        hidden. Like everything else that is beautiful and good it had to be brought
                        to the light. It was not to serve as a mere post, as in the semi-light of an
                        Egyptian temple, but through itself beautiful, was made to carry the more
                        beautiful sculpture of the Greek tympanums. </p>
                    <p>The Egyptian used his column primarily to support the ends of his roof slabs,
                        which were too short to reach from wall to wall. True, he arranged his
                        columns in two or more symetri- cal rows, dividing his great walls into
                        naves and aisles. He also decorate his column most beautifully with colour.
                        His building, in its simplicity, was a rectangle formed of massive walls on
                        the exterior and rows of columns in the interior for the support of his
                        roof. The Greeks reversed this order, as in the case of the Theseum at
                        Athens. They built a cell or naos as a nucleus and surrounded the walls of
                        it with one or more rows of columns, something like a verandah. They railed
                        their buildings in with beautiful columns. </p>
                    <p>Although the Greeks also used the columns in the interior of their buildings
                        the column became principally an external feature; and in accordance with
                        its proportion, the form of its base, or the absence of a base, the decora-
                        ion of its capital and contour of its mouldings, it became the index for the
                        discrimination of the style of a building. </p>
                    <p>The column is no longer a useful detail of architecture to be used when
                        required, but has become the domineering and obtrusive master upon all
                        occasions. The column is much worshipped in Alexandria and often without
                        reason. A column is the sign and seal of respec- tability. It is to be seen
                        in all kinds of positions; sometimes without a foundation, at others without
                        a head and occasionally has to be supplied with elaborate bracketing to hold
                        it up. In nine cases out of ten it is probably incongruous and unnecessary.
                        If it cannot be had in polished marble it will be built of soft brick and
                        softer Mex stone, plastered over and painted to look like the finest vert
                        antique. It should not be understood here that objection is offered to the
                        painting of wood or stone; on the contrary, the practice of the ancients may
                        often be followed with pleasing results in this beautiful climate. The
                        Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and Venetians painted their buildings on a large
                        scale, but <cb n="2"/>not to deceive, at least in their noblest days. "In a
                        word," says Mr. Maspero, "paint- ing was in Egypt the mere humble servant of
                        architecture and sculpture." </p>
                    <p>"What are you to to?" I was asked by a learned friend. "If you cannot have
                        the rea- city ten you must have good imitation." By no means. If you cannot
                        have granite or marble, then use sandstone, or Marseilles brick, or if you
                        cannot do this and must build in soft Mex stone, plaster and paint it if you
                        like. Use paint both as a perspective and as a decoration if you think well,
                        but do not let your columns or the sides go your staircases tell an untruth
                        to every visitor who honours you house with a visit. (To be continued)</p>

                    <head>CAPTURED BY BRIGANDS IN MACEDONIA.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Philip Martin Wills, who las July was captured by brigands in Macedonia,
                        recently arrived in England, and has been relating his experiences. He
                        states that he was born of British parents in Constantinople and served in
                        South Africa. Subsequently he entered the service of the Regie de Tabac, the
                        tobacco monopoly in Turkey. He was controller of the tobacco cultivation in
                        the vilayet of Monastir in Macedonia. Early in July las he was cap- tired by
                        Bulgarian brigands. He was taken to the mountains, where he was forced to
                        write a letter to the chief of the Regie de Tabac, enclosing letters to the
                        Consul at Monastir and to his own brother. These letter were not delivered.
                        Mr. Wills was also forced to write other letters to the Consul direct and
                        these were delivered. In them a demand was made for a ransom of 6,000
                        Turkish liras. The Consul, upon receipt of the letters, went to the Turkish
                        authorities, who said that Mr. Wills was no doubt in league with the
                        brigands. About two and a half monts after the capture Mr. Wills had his
                        left ear cut off, and this was sent in a letter to the Consul at Monastir,
                        with a demand that the ransom should be forwarded, or the other ear and the
                        nose of the captive would be cut off and sent. Upon this, Mr. Graves, the
                        English Consul General for Salonika, was sent to Monastir to see what could
                        be done, but the negotiations with the brigands failed. Even- tally, after
                        such ill-treatment, Mr. Wills escaped on November 12 and found his way to a
                        village name Sarisvor. The Turkish authorities took Mr. Wills to Resna,
                        whence the commandant of gendarmerie, who had been sent after him, took him
                        to Monastir. Here, at the Vali's house, the British Acting Vice-Consul met
                        him and took him to the British Consulate. He remained there 15 days, and
                        Mr. Wills alleges that, in the meantime, the Turkish authorities got the
                        people at Resna with whom Mr. Wills has lodged after his escape to make a
                        false declaration that a month previously he had come to the place fully
                        armed as a brigand and had slept the night there. This Mr. Wills
                        emphatically denies, and says he has proved to the satisfaction of the
                        British Consulate that it was impossible for him to have been there at the
                        time. A letter, he says, is in the hands of the British Consulate at
                        Monastir, signed by the gendarmerie, bribing these people to make the
                        declaration, the falseness of which they have since admitted. As certain
                        papers have cast a doubt upon Mr. Will's bona fides, he has made the above
                        statement.</p>

                    <p>ENDANGER THE KIDNEYS.</p>
                    <p>Alcoholic stimulants, and tea, have an in- jurious effect on the kidneys,
                        irritating and inflaming the delicate tissues, and starting such complaints
                        as: Burning Pain or Ache in the Back, Cloudy or Scalding Urine, Excess of
                        Urine, Sediment, Gravel, Rheumatism, Dizzi- ness, Cramp in the Muscles and
                        Limbs, Dulness of the Brain, etc. Doan's Backache Kidney Pills should be
                        used occasionally by all who take Beer, Spirits, and Tea, as this medicine
                        soothes and heals the kidneys, cleanses the ureters and bladder, and flushes
                        the uric poisons from the system. Doan's Pills are purely vegetable, and do
                        not act on the bowels. </p>

                    <p>Dear Sirs:- I don't know how to express my gratitude for the relief Don's
                        Backache Kidney Pills have given me. For sixteen months I was tormented with
                        sciatica; I could scarcely move, but since taking Don's Kidney Pills I have
                        felt nothing of the pains. I can get about now with ease, but before I was
                        cured, my work and everything I did was a burden to me. </p>
                    <p>The pains were chiefly in my back and legs, and sometimes they were so sever
                        that I nearly fell to the ground when out walking. At nights I was so bad
                        that often I have had to get out of bed; I could not lie there and endure
                        the agony. </p>
                    <p>Your Doan's Backache Kidney Pills have effected a perfect cure, and I've
                        never felt anything of the pain since. Please make what use you like of this
                        testimony, and believe me to be, </p>
                    <p>Yours gratefully, </p>

                    <p>3 3/4 years later our representative visited Mr. Guthrie, and asked him
                        whether he had found his cure to be a lasting one. "Indeed I have, Mr.
                        Guthrie replied heartily; "there has been no relapse and I have enjoyed
                        excellent health ever since my cure by Don's Backache Kidney Pills, I can
                        get about well, and I never have any symptoms of kidney complaint." </p>

                    <p>Mrs. W.J. Bryanton, 210 Sherman street, Dennison, Ohio, writes: "I followed
                        the direction you kindly gave me and now I find myself entirely cured. I
                        think your Peruna is the best medicine in the world."</p>
                    <p>Heartfelt Thanks For Relief Found in Pe-ru-na.</p>
                    <p>Miss Jessie S. Dword, 37 South street, Passaic, N.J., writes: "I took Peruna
                        as you directed. I had a dry cough and after using to bottes of Peruna, I
                        found relief. You have my heartfelt thanks." A cough is caused by a
                        catarrhal con- didtion of the thought and bronchial tubes. Remove the
                        catarrh and the cough disappears. Persuna is the remedy for all catarrhal
                        conditions. </p>

                    <p>Miss May Cray, 147 11th street, Brook- lyn, N.Y., writes: "For more than five
                        years I suffered from rheumatic pains in joints, and in damp or stormy
                        weather I was obliged to stay in doors. "Medicine seemed to be of no use un-
                        till I started using Peruna. "I took twelve bottles in all, although it is
                        six months ago since I stopped. "I have had no return of my old com- plaint,
                        in spite of the fact that I have been out in all sorts of weather during the
                        severe winter." No better remedy was ever devised by the medical profession
                        for the mitigation of climatic ailments than Peruna.</p>

                    <p>Mrs. J.A. Baker, 380 Locust avenue, Amsterdam, N.Y., writes: "I feel it my
                        duty to write and tell you what Peruna has done for me, so that all those
                        who are troubled as I was may find the same speedy cure. "Four years ago I
                        lost my voice, so that I was unable to speak above a whisper for seven
                        weeks. Our family doctor could do nothing for me. "After seven weeks of
                        suffering, I read som circulars in regard to Peruna. "I bought a bottle at
                        once and took it in teaspoonful doses every hour, and in two days I could
                        talk. I will never be without it." For free medical advice, write to Dr.

                    <p>For special direction everyone should read "The Ills of Life." a copy of

                    <p>Irregularite et indecision, tels sont les deux mots qui dépeignent le mieux
                        l'état de notre marche pendant la semaine qui vient de finir. Il ne faudrait
                        pourtant pas trop se plaindre de cette allure, car sans elle et les
                        fréquentes fluctuations soudaines et presque toujours tres rapides sur la
                        vieille récolté qu'elle nous a values, l'intérêt aurait complètement manque
                        et l'atention serial peut être restée entière- ment concentrée sur le
                        Novembre seul, ce qui aurait été insuffisant. Au fond cependant, il n'y a
                        rien eu d'extraordinaire, mais ce qu'il y a de remarquable a relever, c'est
                        qu'en definitive c'est la fermeté qui a fini par prévaloir et cela en debit
                        des nouvelles de l'etranger et de la baisse marquee de l'americain,
                        circonstance qui pour le moins aurait du contrecarrer la dernière reprise.
                        En somme, la speculation a montre encore une fois qu'elle n'avait fait que
                        se recueillir pour mieux agir ensuit, et s'est uniquement en sachant mettre
                        a profit les causes purement locales, qui lui ont été favorables, qu'elle a
                        reuse dans ses efforts a soutenu les cours. Maintenant, il ne faudrait pas
                        trop se hater a conclure par la qu'elle est a meme de con- tinuer fans cette
                        voie pour longtemps et que le succès viendra toujours lui sourire, ca d'un
                        autre cote le découvert sur Juillet n'existe pas et comme l'aencheance
                        approche, elle est bien forcee de tourner les yeux vers le commerce
                        d'exportation, en dehors duquel il n'y a pas de salut, cette année,
                        lorsqu'il devra s'agir de la ;liquidation finale. En effet, nos exportateurs
                        sont aujourd'hui les seuls vendeurs sérieux de contrats contre leur stock,
                        et si un réveil de la demande de la part de la consommation ne survient pas
                        d'ici a quelques jours pour les aider a écouler la marchandise au dehors, il
                        y aura selon toute apparence, des le premeier jour du mois prochain, une
                        emission generale de filieres que, d'aucune façon, les détenteurs de Juillet
                        non professionnels ne peuvent souhaiter. Il est certain qu'a un certain prix
                        la filature, qui pour le moment se repose sur les achats a bon marche
                        qu'elle a faits en dernier lieu, re- viendra au marche pour combler les
                        besoins qu'elle peut encore avoir a couvrir pour le res- tant de la saison,
                        et, par consequent, une de- bandage, au vrai sens du mot, ne semble guère
                        probable; mais, d'autre part aussi, une hausse comme l'entendent nos
                        spéculateurs n'est plus possible, surtout si, au lieu de simplement
                        soutenir, il leur prenait la fantaisie de pousser les cours d'une manière
                        factice er inconsidérée. Ce qui precede ne s'applique pas a la nou- velle
                        recolte, etant donne que la situation de celle ci est tout a fait différent
                        te de celle du Juillet, le deport entre le Novembre et ce der- nier étant de
                        près de 5 tallaris, fait qui est de nature a retarder toute baisse sérieuse
                        jusqu'a ce que les cours de l'Américain viennent régler les nôtres. Aussi,
                        l'opinion prédominante est- elle que l'on peut soutenir encore pendant
                        quelque temps le Novembre et d'autant plus facilement que ces temps derniers
                        la filature a fini par s'y intéresser. Certes, ses achats n'ont pas eu une
                        grande importance, mais en somme elle a opéré sur Octobre a December et cela
                        fournit un certain appui aux intéressés a la hausse, sans pourtant les aider
                        a faire mous- ser les prix, attendu que l'interieur de son cote continue a
                        vendre et ferment aux exporta- leurs de trouver chez le cultivateur une
                        partie <cb n="2"/>de leur couverture. En resume, le niveau actuel du
                        Novembre n'est pas trop risque et la specu- latin en s'y engagement ne
                        s'expose pas a de grands déboires. </p>
                    <p>Ceci dit en guise d'entree en matière et en meme temps comme conclusion de ce
                        que nous pensons, passons a la revue du marche. La fermete constatee a la
                        cloture de cen- dread dernier, s'est accentuée le lendemain et quoique le
                        maximum de 21 3/4 pratique dans la matinee n'ait pu être maintenu, la seance
                        n'en a pas moins fini sur la cote de 21 19/32, soit avec une avance de 7/32. </p>
                    <p>En réalité cela a paru être un indice de fai- blesse, mais une propagande
                        acharnée faite par les détenteurs du Juillet a attire une foule d'acheteurs
                        a l'ouverture de lundi et comme premier cours il a été feit 21 13/16.
                        Seulement, quelques offres sérieuses ayant de suite calme les principaux
                        meneurs, la puce vint aux oreilles des nouvelles recrues et au lieu de finir
                        par être la victime des chauffeurs qui ne cher- chaient qu'a leur passer
                        leurs paquets ils pas- seront immédiatement dans le camp oppose, ce qui a en
                        pour effet de nous faire reculer de 7/16 de taller en nous rament a notre
                        point de depart qui avait été de 21 3/8. </p>
                    <p>Les deux jours suivants, la tenue e été en- core moins brillante et les deux
                        matinees ont fini a 21 1/16; mais comme a ce niveau les ven- deurs se
                        faisaient rares, leurs adversaires ont pu facilement réagirez et comme
                        résultat le Juillet est remonte a 28 1/2 pour finir aujourd'hui a 21/716. </p>
                    <p>En definitive c'est 1/16 de gagne et cela n'est pas du tout mal si l'on tient
                        compte de l'abs- mention du commerce et de la baisse de l'Ame- ricin qui
                        aurait du tout au moins contrecarrer la reprise. </p>
                    <p>Le Novembre, malgré les attaques dont il a été l'objet, a eu une tenue bien
                        plus satis- faisante et c'est a peine s'il a touche le cours de 16 23/32 au
                        plus bas; toutefois, comme cloture finale, nous le trouvons a 16 25/32, soit
                        1/16 au-dessous de la semaine passée. Sous le rapport de l'activite, par
                        contre, il n'a rien laisse a desirer, ce qui s'explique par le fait que
                        l'interet concentre sur lui est désor- mais colossal. </p>
                    <p>Le marche du disponible, tout en restant sootenu a curse des contrats, a été
                        d'un calme plat parfait, tant a cause du marque de de- mande, que du peu de
                        choix qu'offre la mar- chandise a la vente. </p>
                    <p>Quant aux prix, li résulte de la cote officielle eatable ce matin, que les
                        Mit Affifi et les pro- dances Haute-Egypte sont en hausse de 1/4 de taller,
                        mais en réalité ce n'est qu'a cause des contrats que cette modification a
                        été apportee. </p>
                    <p>Du cote des exportations, il y a eu surprise agreeable pour les haussier a
                        laquelle il faut attribuer le soutien de ce matin: Depassant toute
                        prevision, le total de la semaine a fini par atteindre 9,500 Balles contre
                        9,600 l'an- nee dernière. Au fond l'augmentation n'a eu lieu qu'au detriment
                        du chiffre reconsidérer pour la premiere semaine Juin, mais en attendant
                        cela ne l'a pas empêchée de produire son effet. Comme stock, nous sommes
                        maintenant a contras 716.000 contre contrats 1.273,000, soit une nouvelle
                        augmentation de cantars 22.000 dans le deficit relever la semaine passée et
                        une autre amelioration de la position statique en favenr des haussiers. </p>
                    <p>Liverpool, n'a guère été chaud pour les egyptiens avec ses ventes atteignant
                        a peine 1300 balles pours la semaine; par contre, du cote des prix, il y a a
                        enregistre une hausse de 1/8 sur le spot, de 4/64 sur le Juin et le <cb
                            n="3"/>Juillet et de 2/64 sur le Novembre qui ont cloture respectivement
                        a 10 5/8 et 10 10/64; 9 62/64 et 8 50/64. </p>
                    <p>Sur les américains disponibles il y a eu aussi peu d'activite et quant aux
                        cours nous les trouvons en baisse de 18 points sur le spot, de 21 sur le
                        Juillet Aout et de 16 pour l'Octobre Novembre. Apres tout, ce recul est
                        encore infe- rieur a celui qui s'est vérifié a New York a la suite de la
                        liquidation du groupe haussier de la position sur l'ancienne récolté. </p>
                    <p>On dit que cette liquidation n'a d'autre but que de permettre a Price et
                        consorts de s'inte- lesser plus largement a la nouvelle récolte qui leur
                        offre un plus grand champ d'action. Cela pent être vrai, mais en memetempsne
                        pourrait- on pas croire qu'en vue d'un rapport défavo- table a leurs
                        interests du Bureau d'Agriculture, ils ont voulu se reserver la possiblilire
                        d; aider éventuellement a l'écrasement des cours avant de commencer leurs
                        achats out leurs rachats sur la prochaine récolte ? </p>
                    <p>Le rapport est anxieusement attendu pour le 4 courant et les derniers
                        pronostics feraient croire qu'il sera baissier. En attendant, et pour
                        commencer nous avons l'estimation de la superficie ensemencée
                        donneaujourd'hui meme par le Chronicle de New York wui est de 31,500,000
                        Acres, contre 28,200,000 l'annee dernière. Quelques intéressés ont beau
                        cabler que la baisse a dit son dernier not; avec des chiffres pareils, sils
                        venaient a être confirmes, nous pourrions bien reculer encore et les con-
                        tinuelles offres de Sud ne sont nullement de nature a tranquilliser a ce
                        sujet. </p>
                    <p>Chez nous, il n'y a rien de particulier a dires quant a la marche de la
                        récolte et si nos lectures desiring quelques details, ils les trouveront
                        dans le Resume de Mai de la Produce Association que nous publions plus

                    <p>Malgré les petits arrivages, le cours du disponible avaient baisse au
                        commencement de la semaine et pour un moment nous étions tombes a P.T. 68;
                        mais comme les exporta- tons ont fini par se developper un peu et que les
                        contrats se sont relevés a leur tour, il y a eu reprise ces deux dernièrs
                        jours et c'est a 70 que la semaine a fini. </p>
                    <p>A moins de circonstances imprévues, une ame- libration ultérieure semble
                        probable pour la semaine prochaine a cause des embarquements qui ont tout a
                        fait l'air de vouloir atteindre 80.000 Ardebs. </p>
                    <p>Par suite de manipulations baissières, le Juillet était tombe a P.T. 69 3/4,
                        mais une contre attaque vigoureuse de haussiers n'a pas tarde a le faire
                        remonter a P.T. 71 3/4; toutefois, comme clôture de la semaine, nous le
                        trouvons a 71.- Les chances restent ce- pendant favorables, car le juin est
                        rare sur le marche et selon toute apparence il n'y aura pas de grosse
                        filière pour venir peser ou produire meme un désarroi passager. Hull a

                    <p>L'Angleterre n'a rien fait encore en nouvelle revolts, mais on a fini par
                        parler d'un prix quelconque et celui mentienne en dernier lieu a été de £ 6

                    <p>La temperature en Mai a ete un peu trop fraiche, surtout dans la premiere
                        moitie du mois, et continue a être irrégulière. Le développement de la

                        general dans son avancement. Neanmoins, l'état des jeunes cotonniers sem-
                        ble sain et la plupart de nos correspondants esperente qu'avec un peu plus
                        de chaleurs ils pourront regagner une grande partie du retard. Les

                    <p>Cette semaine a bien débuté, mais de suite, un affaiblissement s'est produit,
                        témoignant ainsi du manque de souffle du marche. Les essais de hausse ont
                        pourtant été frequents, mais rien n'est venu répondre aux ardeurs des
                        audacieux qui cherchaient a en profiter. La tension monteare persiste,
                        parait-il, a Londres, car non seulement la place de New- Your est toujours
                        mal pourvue, mais on s'y attend a une prolongation de cet état de choses.
                        Une des plus grandes et des plus fortes com- pagnies americanizes de chemin
                        de fer aurait decide de créer pour ses besoins urgents des bons 4 1/2 % a 18
                        mois de date et de les offrir a un prix légèrement inférieur au pair. Nous
                        allons faire un relevé du marche de la semaine qui s'est beaucoup ressenti
                        des nou- velles d'Europe et a été suddisament mouve- mente. </p>
                    <p>Samedi le marche très anime donne lieu a de grosses transactions, une hausse
                        presque générale des valeurs se produit. L'opinion est bonne et tout le
                        monde s'attend a ce que ce mouvement; continue. </p>
                    <p>Lundi, l'ouverture est bonne quelques affaires se font puis le marche
                        s'affaiblit graduellement et cloture très calme. Mardi au contraire, nous a
                        apporte un marche faible a l'ouverture, qui s'est termine assez ferme. </p>
                    <p>Mercredi marche faible, le cours s'alourdis- sent. </p>
                    <p>Jeudi, ouverture animée, quelques affaires ont été traitées spécialement dans
                        le départe- ment des petites valeurs. </p>
                    <p>Aujourd'hui marche calme sans être mau- vais, la Delta Land presque seule a
                        sonne lieu a quelques échanges; les autres valeurs res- tent stationnaires. </p>
                    <p>Le marche a eu, comme on le voit, de gran- des fluctuatuions; alternative de
                        hauts et de bas qui nous fait penser qu'il serait utile de donner a nos
                        lectures un relevé des divers cours des valeurs les plus échangées durant
                        ces six derniers jours. </p>
                    <p>La Delta Land a eu les honneurs de la semaine, donnant lieu a de ombreuses
                        affai- res, aussi, a-t-elle subi des carabins très sen- bibles. Samedi et
                        lundi elle cote 4 7/32, mardi elle descend de 3/32 a 4 1/8; ce mouvement a
                        la bailee s'accuentue mercredi ou elle cloture a 4. Jeudi nouvelle reprise
                        de 3/32 a 4 3/32, aujourd'hui e'le faiblit de 1/32 a 4 1/16. L'agricole, est
                        samedi et lundi a 9 7/8, elle perd 1/8 mardi a 9 3/4, depuis elle est restée
                        stationnaire a ce dernier cours. </p>
                    <p>Les Estates, sont échangés samedi et lundi a 1 11/16, mardi ils baissent de
                        1/16 a 1 5/8, resent stationnaires mercredi, baissent encore de 1/32 a 1
                        19/32 jeudi, et aujourd'hui con- servent la meme cote qu'hier. </p>
                    <p>Les Urbaines a 6 1/4 samedi, s'addaiblissent de 1/16 a 6 3/16 lundi, cette
                        baisse s'accentue mardi a 6 1/8; mercredi elles restent a 6 1/8, gagnent
                        1/16 a 6 3/16 jeudi, et reviennent aujourd'hui a 6 1/8. </p>
                    <p>Les Egyptian Hotels, spécialement, ont subi cette semaine un hausse sensible
                        pleine- ment justifiée du reste, étant donne l'état florissant de cette
                        société; nous donnons ci-dessous un petit appercu de sa situation presente. </p>
                    <p>Apres les ventes effectuées a ce jour, cette Compagnie possède encoure 65,000
                        mètres de terrain, y compris le domaine de Ghezireh Palace Hotel. </p>
                    <p>Ce domaine étant d'une superficie de 30,000 mètres, il resterait disponibles
                        35,000 mètres, pour lesquels des offres auraient été faites a raison de £ 10
                        le metro, ce qui représenterait £ 350,000. </p>
                    <p>On met aussi en ligne de compte la conces- sion d'eau et d'electricite pour
                        l'ile de Ghezi- reh, que la Society ne se serait pas encore decided a cider
                        pour £ 50,000. </p>
                    <p>Or, one value qu'avec le seul produit des ventes de terrains deja faites, les
                        115,000 ac- tions de la Societe pourraient être largement remboursées aux
                        abords de £ 4. </p>
                    <p>En ajoutant le montant éventuel de la vente des 35,000 mètres restants, de la
                        concession d'eau et d'electricite, etc., il s'ensuivrait que la valeur
                        intrinsèque du titre serait d'enviren £ 10. </p>
                    <p>Pour ce qui des nouvelles concernant le project de creation d'une Society
                        égyptienne en remplacement de a Compagnie actuelle, ces informations
                        tendraient, dit-on, a se confirmer. Le capital de la Society nouvelle serait
                        de L.E. 400,000 divise en 100.000 actions de L.E. 4, a la souscription

                    <head>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</head>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance
                        with the printed directions accompanying it, will the shattered health be
                        restored,</p>
                    <p>THE EXPIRING LAMP OF LIFE LIGHTED UP AFRESH,</p>
                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up," and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
