                    QUESTION OF THE LEADERSHIP.
                    
                    London, February 5.
                    
                    The Unionist party will meet next week in order to consider the position.
                    
                    The ‘Time says that Mr. Chamberlain desires to make the tariff reform paramount in thepolioy of the Unionists. It is understood l that Mr. Balfour will not assent, considering it inexpedient in view of the result of the elections. If Mr. Balfour adheres to this standpoint, Mr. Chamberlain, who is personally unwilling to take the leadership, will propose a third person, probably Mr, Long, to lead the party. Mr. Balfour deolines to acquiesce an 1 considers it highly inadvisable to exclude from the party the Unionists who do not oonour in tbe Chamberlaini te fiscal policy.
                    
                    The Unionist newspapers are divided on the leadership of the party. The “Standard,” the "Morning Post,” and the "Globe’^are strongly Chamberlainite. Others uphold Mr. Balfour, The "Times” strongly deprecates any widening of the cleavage and considers^that in the present situation the Unionist party has no nee 1 to formulate a vary definite policy. It is noteworthy that the personal relations between Mr. Balfour and Mr. Chamberlain are most friendly.	(Reuter)</p>
