                    <head>ARMY REFORM</head>
                    <p>What Mr. Halane will do at the War Office lies in the womb of the future, but
                        if we are to believe his own utterances we know what he will not do. He has
                        assured us very emphatically that he means to keep Army administration quite
                        outside party politics, and hopes to place its efficiency before all
                        questions of economy and finace. Thee are brave words, rather suggestive of
                        the novice who has never yet benn under the Treasury lash, and we may recall
                        them some day when he has been compelled to prune down his too ambitious
                        estimate to meet the requirements of some cheese-paring Budget. Another
                        promise will be more easily kept. Mr Haldane should have no difficulty in
                        maintain pleasant relations with his military colleagues. the expert
                        memmbers of the Army concil, and will avoid friction cause by differeces of
                        opinon and want of personal sympathy which certainly porevailed often during
                        the late regime. The new secaratary of state has the advantage of an affable
                        and concililiatory manner, and he has begun well by a franl admission of his
                        ignoreance of army affairs and his willingnedd to be guided by those who are
                        better informed. The chief fault in Mr. Arnold-Forster was that he knew
                        everything better than anyone else. He was, moreover tied and bound by the
                        previously-expressed views on some of the most intricate points in a
                        business of the most extreme difficulty. Mr. Haldane tells us he has an open
                        mind and if this attitude is lasting and permits him to accept the best that
                        his predecessors have already given us, there may be some hope of a
                        settlement of matter still in a fluid condition.</p>
                    <p>We hear much of the provision of a national army as the chief aim to be helf
                        in view by our new War Office administrator, and no one will question its
                        paramount importance. The phrase is mere bombastunless it is analysed and an
                        exact definition arrived at. The commom idea is that defence of Great
                        Britain is the principal raison detre of a national army. Many people
                        discount this on the faith or rather hasty conclusions that invasion is out
                        of the question. We leave this consideration aside, convinced that our real
                        and more pressing needs lie beyond the four seas- needs at the remote
                        extremities of our far-flung frontier line, and no doubt for the moment in
                        abeyance. Yet our army exsits primarily for foreign service, for the current
                        police duties of the Empire and to meet the larger and more desperate
                        emergencies that may some day arise. To prepare for them acequately is the
                        true role of the far-seeing War Minister, and the best, the only effective,
                        means is the constitution of an enormus reserve of stored up strength
                        available for prompt mobilisation in the hour of trial. The auxiliary forces
                        can never be utilised on their present footing, and we know now that the
                        sugguested organization of a home service army will not work on the lines
                        proposed by Mr. Arnold-Forester. The necessary personnel are not
                        forthcoming; the men will not join the newly devised regiments, for some
                        unexplained reason another instance of the caprices of voluntary enlistment.
                        The problem remains to be solved by Mr. Haldane, if indeed, he touches it at
                        all unless it is forced upon him.</p>
                    <p>He has a full programme and has many urgent needs on his card. The question
                        of recruiting is, as ever, of the first importance, and likely to become
                        accentuated should the party now in power be beguiled into coqueting with
                        Home Rule. It has been pointed out that with an independent Parliament in
                        Dublin the British Army would look in vain for Irish recruits, hitherto so
                        valuable an addition to the forces of the crown. Apart from their soldierly
                        qualities, the loss in numbers would be felt seriously. Mr. Haldane has
                        declared himself, as might have been expected, the determined opponent of
                        any form of conscription. What if it is forced upon him as the direct result
                        of making Irishmen foreigness? Let us hope that the notion is far-fetched
                        and that the evil consequences of Home Rule in this regard may be averted. A
                        more pressing requirement today is to find officers for all branches of the
                        service and more particularly the auxiliary forces, where the dearth
                        constantly increases. Neither the Militia nor the Volunteeers can take their
                        place in the national array until this defect is mended, and the remedy,
                        except by regular payment is not easy to find. The shortage in the regulars
                        has been in a measure dealt with by Mr. Arnold Forster, although hardly on
                        large permanent lines. The late War Minister has to some extent smoothed his
                        successor's path by carrying out the rearmament of the field artillery and
                        the introduction of the new infantry rifle, but his legacy of the great
                        General Staff is a more doubtful asset not readily or easily realisable.</p>

                    <p>According to the "Straits Times" a procession of Hindus took place recently
                        in Singapore, the men being under hypnotic influence and with barbs of iron
                        and wood sticking in their flesh. Interest in the procession centred in a
                        woman, known for her great piety. She joined in the procession with a brass
                        pot, containing pure water, which she hoped would turn into milk.</p>
                    <p>To her disappointment and dismay she found on uncovering the pot at her
                        destination that the water was unchanged. Not to be outdone, she tried to
                        bring about another miracle. Seizing a knife which she carried, she cut off
                        her tongue about an inch from the end and laid it on a leaf in front of her.
                        With blood dripping from her mouth, she knelt before this bit of tongue,
                        praying and waiting for what remained of it in her mouth to grow to its
                        original length. The temple was filled with spectators, who remianed till a
                        late hour to see miracle number two brought off.</p>
                    <p>The woman waited till a little past midnight, most of the time in a kneeling
                        posture, but the tongue would not grow. The temple authorities advised her
                        to return home, as they declared her not "good enough for miracles."</p>

                        car, for which a special line was laid leading to Messrs. Benoini and

                        Mr. Benoini's words of welcome. Lord Cromer remained about three- quarters

                        <p>To THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. Sir, - The outspoken letter, which
                            you published to-day OQ the forthcoming Alexandria Municipal Elections,
                            represents the general feeling of the respectable portion of the com
                            munity. In fact, nobody with any self-respect ought to trouble to vote,
                            for the whole thing is an utter farce, and I cannot imagine how any
                            honest man«an desire to ^e elected to such an institution except for
                            purely personal motives. Of oonrse these motives may be innoxious. For
                            exMnple some valgarian may de ire to ffe: himself as a candidate becaupe
                            he is stupid enough to believe that the title of Municipal Councillor
                            will help to give him some position over and above that conferred on him
                            by hisjvealth. Such types of persons are at any rate better than the
                            sordid self seeker, who only wants a seaton the Municipal Council in
                            order to make money by using the Municipality as a tool for his
                            nefarious s jhemes. Ypur correspondent complains that among the

                        besides a comparatively fewer number of day-pupils ; satisfactory
                        arrangements are, however, now concluded for day-pupils being trained in
                        greater numbers at the workshop for the blind which is being opened at
                        Boulac, and which should be ready for working 6ar)y this month (Febxoaty). A
                        teaoher from England has been specially engaged to superintend this branch,
                        which principally comprises basket-making and chait-making, to to time, as
                        the number of pupils is increased. Many of the popils are already adept at
                        re-caning of ohatrs, for which there is a constant and considerable demand.
                        Specimens of work are on sale at the dep6t (at 8, Chareh Bab ii-Hadid), near
                        the Cairo railway station, where orders for work oan aUo be given. At the
                        same time, the institution pro- duces literature for the blind in the form
                        of Arabio Braille, and not only supplies books required by the pupils in
                        their sohool-work, bat fills the literary needs of others who are blind
                        throughout Egypt and in adjacent countries where Arabio is spoken. The kind
                        interest in the institution displayed by H.H. the Khedive, and by the Earl
                        of Cromer, has been of the greatest vriue, and the Egyptian Government,
                        also, has granted it an annual subsidy; it is therefore an easier task for
                        the wide circle of the public, both resident and visitors, whose sympathies
                        o*n picture what life would be to themselves individually if entirely
                        deprived of eyesight, to share in helping this work for the blind, by
                        contributing to it in accordance with their several abilities The need of
                        help in this direction is really almost more pressing in Egypt than
                        elsewhere, because of the hopelessness of ; vett heir infirmity 'and the

                        unfortunate class sink. All contributions to the income of the institution
                        are applied exclusively for the benefit of the blind papils, and ths whole
                        work of administration by the committ3e is done gratuitously, and, in
                        addition, the late founder's family having generously secured the premises

                            <p>The Unionist party will meet next week in order to consider the
                                position. </p>
                            <p>The 'Time says that Mr. Chamberlain desires to make the tariff reform
                                paramount in thepolioy of the Unionists. It is understood l that Mr.
                                Balfour will not assent, considering it inexpedient in view of the
                                result of the elections. If Mr. Balfour adheres to this standpoint,
                                Mr. Chamberlain, who is personally unwilling to take the leadership,
                                will propose a third person, probably Mr, Long, to lead the party.
                                Mr. Balfour deolines to acquiesce an 1 considers it highly
                                inadvisable to exclude from the party the Unionists who do not
                                oonour in the Chamberlaini te fiscal policy. </p>
                            <p>The Unionist newspapers are divided on the leadership of the party.
                                The "Standard," the "Morning Post," and the "Globe'^are strongly
                                Chamberlainite. Others uphold Mr. Balfour, The "Times" strongly
                                deprecates any widening of the cleavage and considers^that in the
                                present situation the Unionist party has no nee 1 to formulate a
                                vary definite policy. It is noteworthy that the personal relations
                                between Mr. Balfour and Mr. Chamberlain are most friendly.

                    <p>Below we give a few extracts from the Eure J?ean Press comments on the
                        inauguration c t the Berber-Suakin Railway :— </p>
                    <p>V; "STANDARD." </p>
                    <p>The new railway from the dile to the R'd 8ea, which was formally opened on
                        Siturdiy by Lord Cromer, may be added to the list if signal benefits which
                        the laud of Egypt owes to the influence, *he incitement, and, we need no* be
                        ashamed to add, the interference of English men. But for the bsnefioent part
                        that Englanl has played in Egyptian affairs, it is more th* n probable that
                        the Sudan, to this day, would b sank in barbarism and anarohy, unless,
                        indeed, some fanatical conqneror from the Upper Ni e had not succeeded in
                        overrunning Lower Egypt with his hordes. A Sudan under an orderly
                        Government, and likely to become a prosperous province of the Khedive's
                        dominions, would have been an unattainable ideal. Thanks to the military
                        achievements of Lord Kitchene*, and to the able and vigorous administration
                        of Lord Cromer, whose share in the work the viotor of Omdurman was always
                        eager to acknowledge, the Sadan was recovered, and the new railway will do
                        more than anything to develop its resefaroes and ensnre the maintenance of
                        the Khedive's authority </p>
                    <p>Nothing bat a complete reversal aud abandonment of the wise and benevolent
                        polioy which has been followed in Egypt for the past twenty years and more
                        could prevent the fulfilment of Lord Cromer's most sanguine expectation* ;
                        and, indeed, so mnch has a'ready been accomplished that it wonld pnzzle the
                        most malignant and mischievous genius ever entrusted with the control of
                        public affairs to reverse the engines of progress. The machinery of good
                        government and far-sighted administration is in working order both in Egypt
                        and the Sudan, and it is hard to oonoeive the growth of any sinister force
                        powerful enough to oheok it. At the same time, we cannot help noticing with
                        Atisfaotion that Lord Cromer disclaims any intention of relinquishing the
                        task which he has disoharged so well as long as health and strength are left
                        to him. His presenoe in Egypt is, indeed, the surest guarantee that the
                        interests of England, will not suffer through any change in the direotion of
                        the. affairs of this nation ; and that the develop ment of the resouroes of
                        the Sudan, and the steady reclamation of its people, will proceed without
                        interruption. </p>

                    <p>It is only the unimaginative who say that the Age of Romance ha > gone by for
                        ever. Marvels are being accomplished in these falsely-styled prosaic days,
                        which equal anti surpass the most astonishing aohievements of bygone ages.
                        For example, we record to-day the opening by Lord Cromer of the new railway
                        from the Red Sea to Berber, which deserves a place among the modern wonders
                        of the world. Not, of coarse, because of the engineering difficulties, met
                        and overcome, that make some railways famoas. The laying of a line across
                        three hundred miles of sand doe3 not exoite the wonder* that is aroused by
                        the piercing of the Simplon* Tunnel, by the spanning of the Victoria Falls,
                        by the asoent of a Swiss mountain, or by colossal achievements like the
                        Trans-Siberian Railway, which flows eastward for thousands of miles in
                        unbroken sequence. There have, of coarse,been special difficulties in the
                        Sadan, difficulties of transport, of panoity of labour, of overpowering
                        heat, of sudden washouts sweeping away in a few hours the work of weeks. For
                        surmounting these in a short fourteen months Lieutenant Colonel Macauley is
                        justly entitled to the glowing praise which Lord Cromer lavished upon him on
                        Saturday, and, like all else in Egypt and the Sudan, the thing has been done
                        not only efficiently, but oheaply. It has cost less than a million and a
                        half pounds Egyptian, for money is not. wasted in the Nile Valley, where the
                        Administration outs its coat according to its oloth, orrefases permission to
                        out at all. But the real miraole of the new railway is not physical, but
                        moral. Twenty-one years ago, almo*t to the very day, General Gordon died the
                        death of a hero on the steps of the Residency at Khartonm. The work of
                        civilisation seemed to be blotted out absolutely. commerce. Port Sadan, the
                        new port, forty-five miles north of Saakiu,whioh has been judged to offer
                        batter harbourage than the p'aoe which it is certain to supersede, will know
                        no diserimir. ating tariff'. All traders will fare alike; tin prizes will
                        fall to the cleveresf. This' is the best answer which Great Britain conld
                        make to those belated rritioa— now a rapidly dwindling band - who say that
                        she has only s iught her owu selfish ends in the Sudan, and deny her title
                        deeds. The policy ofthe open door involves, however, one danger to the niwly
                        found prosperity of the Sudan, on which Lord Cromer spoke very wisely and to
                        the point. O^en doors attract undesirable goods and undesirable persons, who
                        enter with the honest trader. It will be the duty of the Administration to
                        repress all such by means of rigorous laws, for, tractable as the natives
                        now are—even the members of the old ruling tribe—there is always the
                        possibility of a recrudescence of fanaticism. But on this head Sir Reginald
                        Wingate may be trusted to take adequate precautions, and the advantages of
                        the open door will, it is thought, greatly exceed its drawbacks. We hope
                        that the expectations founded on the completion of this new railway will be
                        triumphantly realised, and that Lord Cromer and his eager and oapable
                        lieutenants may see the Sudan stride rapidly forward along the path of
                        progress. </p>
                    <p>"TRIBUNE." </p>
                    <p>We are glad to see that Lord Cromer did not emphasize the railway's
                        strategical valne. It is not a military, bat a genuine oommeroial railway,
                        designed to open and develop country which hitherto lay stagnant and
                        isolated. Even a railway cannot fertilize a desert, and it will do little
                        for the oonntry between Berber and the coast Bat it taps the fertile Nile
                        valley and brings Khartonm within easy reach of the sea. Its building is an
                        interesting commentary on the Cape-to Cairo scheme .of the late Mr. Rhodes.
                        What Africa needs is not a long backbone railway from north to sonth, bat a
                        series of short lines which will bring the pro dnoe of the interior swiftly
                        down to the ee« Nothing that Khartonm prodaces will stand the cost of the
                        long journey to Alexandria. A short line to the nearest available seaport
                        may at last open up an economic future for the Sadan. </p>

                    <head>REDEMPTIVE FORCES IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>The first great work of redemption recorded in Scripture took place in this
                        remarkable valley of the Nile 3,500 years ago. Then Jehovah called the
                        chosen people ont of Egypt in order that they might develop a religion of
                        apin^tial realities in an atmosphere of relative freedom from pagan
                        domination. The story ' j* familiar to every stndent of Seriptare, foil of
                        the pathos of Israel's unbeliet and disobe- dieice. Now, after nineteen
                        Christian centuries the followers of Christ are striving to give the
                        knowledge of the trne God as it is revealed in Jesus Christ to the people of
                        this land. </p>
                    <p>In a former letter reference was made to the denominational adjustment
                        according to which the United Presbyterians were given the land of Egypt as
                        their field among the countries about the Mediterranean. They have a record
                        of most faithful, wise and efficient service upon which God's blessing has
                        mani: festly rested. Not only have they spread their activities over the
                        Delta* but also into Upper Egypt and on into the oudau. Their great mission
                        house in Cairo bespeaks large interests in Egypt, as well as permanency ot
                        occupation. Their fine college at Assiout, with more than 600 young men and
                        boys in attendance, reminds the visitor of Robert College in Constantinople
                        and the Syrian Protestant College in Beyrout. Here also, as in Turkey, ja
                        and Palestine, the Christian schools are every hand and are crowded to their
                        ntmost capacity. </p>
                    <p>It was with great pleasure that we accepted an invitation to give some time
                        to Egypt, as it was directly in the way of our journey to Ind;8. Some two
                        weeks have given us the opportunity of seeing the work and meeting the
                        workers, We landed at Alexandria, where Rev. William L. McLenahan is the
                        leader of the groop labouring in that thriving, modern city. There were
                        meetings for the workers and a service for the native congregation. It was
                        an agreeable surprise to find a handsome stone church occupied by these
                        native congregations. The building was erected for them by the First United
                        Presbyterian Churoh of Allegheny, and its splendid appearance adds very
                        materially to the general impression throughout the city regarding the
                        importance of the Christian enterprise. </p>
                    <p>Cairo is a great oity. In every part of Egypt the marvellous progress made
                        since the British occupation is constantly in evidence along commercial and
                        political lines, and this is distinctively true in Cairo. It is unfortunate
                        that the same thing oanuot be said regarding religious oonditipns. fn the
                        one respect of religious liberty there is improvement, but in general the
                        British Government favours the jMbbamedani, and not the Christians, in all
                        its rules concerning those features of the public welfare which involve
                        religious preferences. For instance, Eoglish teachers are brought here for
                        the Government sohools, but the Mohamedan Sabbath is observed ; that is
                        Friday, and the schools are all continued on Sunday, the teachers being
                        unable to observe the Christian Sabbath. The Moh»medans laugh at this, and
                        say the British are afraid to interfere with their religious affairs. The
                        Christians do not ask that Mohamedans be debarred from their fullest liberty
                        on Friday, but feel keenly their hardship in not having equal liberty on the
                        Sabbath. The result is that these young teachers have no Sabbath, and many
                        are drifting away from their anchorage in the Christian faith. </p>
                    <p>jrfere are three veterans at Cairo: Drs. f Watson, Ewing and Harvey, all

                        noble womeo, record three decades of faithful service. The schools are
                        crowded, and the preaching services are maintained at six different centres.
                        Meetings of various kinds are held here, the services for the people being
                        crowded, though the large auditorium in theMissionBuilding accommodates
                        nearly a thousand people. A most interesting meeting held regularly each
                        week in Cairo is for Mohamedan =», and is led by a converted Mohamedan, who
                        is one of the finest Arabic scholars in the oity. Evidences multiply to
                        strengthen faith in God's blessing upon the efforts to reach the Moslem
                        people. </p>
                    <p>A four days' conference for all the workers in Egypt was ananged for November
                        7-10, at Assiout, the seat cf the College, so well ad ministered by
                        President J. R. Alexander. It was a notable gathering (f missionaries and
                        native pastors from the Delta to the Sadan. There had been many weeks of
                        faithful prayer lor a great Hewing upon this gathering, and the answer was
                        graciously given. AIL the services were in Arabic for the sake of .the
                        pastors, the five addresses of the writer being interpreted by a most
                        efficient master of both </p>

                        orowd Luxor during the season. * 4 </p>
                    <p>Mention of the tourist season recalls the sad fact that many nominal
                        Christians come tc Egypt and oonduot themselves in such a w*y as to hurt the
                        oause of Christ. An aggravated instance is the example of the Episcopal
                        clergyman at Luxor, who is there for the season at a leading hotel. Having
                        read the service Sabbath mornings, he is the organizer of the afcernoon
                        excursions on that day and the leader of the dances and various
                        entertainments arranged daring the week. Is it strange that many Mohamedans
                        are very slow to believe that Christians aTe truly religious t ' </p>
                    <p>Progress is being steadily noted all along the line, however, in spite of an
                        empty nominal Christianity. The Chnrob of England has sent many faithful
                        representatives to this and other countries about the Mediterranean Set. A
                        new day has dawned upon Egypt, and its blessed light is that which shines
                        from the cross of Christ. Africa is stretohing forth her hands unto God. The
                        God of nations snddealy opened the way, and he will continue to lead his
                        people as they strive to be faithful witnesses for the world's only Saviour.
                        There is an increasing expectation from Goi for Egypt in the prayers of
                        believers, and it will not be long before the Pentecostal blesjings will
                        oome. (From ''The Herald and Presbyter.") </p>

                    <p>The authorities at the British Museum are about to make an C3pecLltfibrt to
                        interest the Government in the purchase by the public ot valuable Egyptian
                        relios.This action, it appears, is doe to the information that John D.
                        Rockefeller has commissioned a well-known American Egyptologist to survey
                        the whole of the Sudab, and has placed praotioally unlimited finances at his
                        disposal to pick up anything he oan that is worth buying. One of the most
                        famous Egyptologists in Eugland, in the oourse of an interview, said he
                        sincerely trusted the Government would take some deoided steps to deal with
                        the habit ot American millionaires of presenting their native towns with
                        Egyptian antiquities, for, with their wealth, the Americans seemed able at
                        present to snap up every thing that is preoions in connection with Egypt's

                    <head>SHOULD CLERGYMEN MARRY?</head>
                    <p>T! e * Nineteenth Century" for February co .tains an interesting article by
                        Bishop Well- don on "The Children of the Clergy." In any just estimot* of
                        the advantages attaching to a married or a celibate clergy (says the writer)
                        it is neoessary to take account of the part which the children of the olergy
                        have played in the national life. It has sometimes seemed to me, therefore,
                        that such stndents of sociology as are interested in the question of a
                        celibate or a marripd olergy might be helped to a just conclusion by
                        ascertaining the sum total, so to call it, of the contribution, whether
                        intePeotual or ethical or spiritual, which the clergy of Great Britain have,
                        since the Reformation, made in the persons of their children, to the
                        treasury of the national life. </p>
                    <p>That splendid literary monr ment the "Dictionary of National Biography" has
                        for the first time in Eoglish history rendered snch an estimate possible. It
                        has been my self-imposed task to examine the parentage of every person whose
                        name ooonrs in the sixty-three original dictionary ; and if I oonfine myself
                        to the oen- tories succeeding the Reformation, daring which the Protestant
                        olergy have been allowed to marry, it is safe to assert not only that the
                        olerioal profession has sent out an immense number of children who,
                        acoording to the language of the Bidding Prayer in the ancient universities,
                        have "served God both in Chnroh and State" with success and distinction, bat
                        that no other profession has sent ont so many children equally successful
                        and equally distinguished </p>
                    <p>To begin with the mere enumeration of names : Although there are, in the
                        "Dictionary of National Biography," a good many names of sons or daughters
                        of the clergy which can scarcely be said to merit national recognition, yet
                        the name* which I marked as worthy of remembranoe for some service performed
                        in religion, -or politics, or liteiatore, or science, or art, or commerce,
                        or philanthropy, or warfare, or some other aspect of the various life of the
                        nation, amouuted to 1270. Large as this numfyar is it consists solely of men
                        and women whope fathers were clergymen or ministers of religion; it takes no
                        account of the many more who were grandchildren either on their fathers' or
                        their mothers' side, or still more remote descendants and relations, of
                        clergymen or ministers. Yet even so it allows something no*: far short of f

                    <p>The superiority has been one not of numbers only brit of degree. From

                    <p>It is not perhaps wonderful (says Bishop Wildon, in concluding his artiole in
                        the "Nineteenth Century") that the olerioal homes of Great Britain thonld
                        have proved to be a soil prolific of learning and virtae and patriotic
                        devotion. For nowhere is domestic life more favourable to the cultivation of

                        with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several things to be
                        considered. To begin with there is the differehce in climate between Egypt

                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMINA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is 'he
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, whicn was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        abo"t 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S. (li
                        wannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum,

                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one • of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside

                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view. PISA is
                        easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there'is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.
                        VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                        Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                        half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and
                        the air and surroundings exceptionally good. </p>

                    <p>GFNOA (La Superba).—The most picturevsque and interesting city- in .Italy,
                        with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                        cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously
                        cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.
                        Tlie patriarchal home of Italy's most an- eient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections, of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs. From Genoa to Milan is a rnatler of only
                        three hours by rail. MILAN is a good centre lor Northern Italy before making
                        the to* r of the Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction,- with its
                        beautiful windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens
                        and the monu mental cemetery are also worth a visit. - Between Bologna and
                        Milan and only an hour and-a-half from Milan is SALSOMAG- GIORE, a renowned
                        health resort on account of its thermal springs, change trains at Borgo San
                        Dovino and in half-an hour you arc at Salsomaggiore. </p>

                    <head>THE ITALIAN LAKES</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and ve* there is the sound' of life at every turn.
                        The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other
                        seaport. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, horn of the sea, no
                        hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tons of Campaniles appear
                        above the horizon, tnen slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy
                        mirage out of the calm lagoon. Going northwards from Milan you make the tour
                        of the beautiful Italian lakes. COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny;
                        is reached in one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza : .Boats
                        leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the snore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano irt three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and- three-quarter hours. </p>

                        delights and grandeurs." LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by
                        train in one-and-affialf hours. It bos a populatien of 10,000 people aud is
                        charmingly situated on the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery.
                        Arcnd it rise M. San Salvatore, M. de Caprinoand M. Generoso. LOCARNO may be
                        reached by rail'from Bellinzona in forty minntes. This pretty town, situated
                        at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an excellent winter
                        resort. The'church Madonpa delSasso, situated above the town,is worth a
                        visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment," by Ciseri, and
                        "The Flight into Egypt,'' by Bramantion. 'LUCERNE.—A striking picture on the
                        Lake of Lucerne facing the Iligi and Pilatus and the snow-clad Alps. In and
                        around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be made from
                        Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous. The Like of Lucerne abounds

                        Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of nature: BRUNNEN, charmingly
                        situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of Lucerne, commands
                        magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the Lake of Uri from
                        \Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axentrasse. A delightful excursion from
