                        there is any limit to the downward tendency. The bona- fide investor who
                        trusts his security need not trouble himself greatly about this. If he is a
                        wise man who has made up his mind not to sell, and who does not trust bis
                        judgment to boy in these troubled times, his simple remedy is to give up
                        reading the stock-and share lists and to put the whole subject out of bis
                        head for the time being. </p>

                        have had the benefit of a long period of active speculation, which is

                        <head>Asphalting Rosetta-Street.</head>
                        <p>The Alexandria Municipality has been much criticised of late owing to the
                            proposal to asphalt Rosetta Gate street at a cost of many thousands of
                            pounds, for it is argued that very many quarters of the city are in such
                            a deplorable state as regards their roads and that to indulge in a huge
                            outlay on this street, which is now paved with Naples stone, is a
                            needless waste of public money. The point of view of the Municipality is
                            based on quite different considerations. Naples stone used to cost from
                            P.T. 38 to P.T. 40 per square metre, but the lowest tender now put
                            before the Municipality for these stones is on a basis of PT. 50 per
                            square metre It is much more expensive than asphalt, as the latter has a
                            ten year's guarantee. Consequently the idea of the Municipality is to
                            take up all the Naples stone on the Rosetta Gate street, part of which
                            imperatively needs immediate repairing, une ail This stone for other
                            streets in the city, and asphalte the entire street. It is believed
                            popularly that the proposal is entirely due to the Councillors of the
                            Municipality and their friends who live on this street, but we are
                            informed that Mr. Emannel Benachi, who is one of the few Councillors who
                            actually live there, is not in favour of the projected asphalting of the

                    <p>(Gazette's Special Service.)</p>
                    <p>London, Tuesday</p>
                    <p>President Roosevelt's message to Congress, which covers more than forty
                        columns, has been received with mixed feelings of satisfaction and
                        discontent that it makes no mention of the Japanese troubles. In reference
                        to the recent financial crisis he remarks that the fundamental business
                        connections are absolu, tely sound. President Roosevelt, who is in no sense
                        hostile to Corporations, says this is the age of combinations. The bulk of
                        the country's business is honestly done. There must be no indiscriminate
                        raid on companies, but it is far preferable to punish prime offenders
                        Railway interests are not to be assailed. He recommends heavy death duties
                        and urges immediate attention to currency by the provision of an emergency
                        issue based on adequate securities approved by the Government under a heavy
                        tax, thus securing its retirement as the demand fell off. The message
                        contains no hint or suggestion of a central National Bank or commission of
                        investigation. </p>

                    <p>In an article on the present prospects of the Egyptian Estates, Ltd., the
                        "Anglo Egyptian Mail" remarks : </p>
                    <p>With regard to the purchase of the Savoy Hotel buildings, which caused so
                        much talk in financial circles, and which was generally OOR sidered to have
                        been a doubtful deal, it may be recorded that offers have been received by
                        the company this month to exchange the Savoy buildings for first-class
                        agricultural land, calculating the value of the Savoy buildings at the rate
                        of £60 per metre square. 1. In the course of the same article our London
                        contemporary says: </p>
                    <p>The first transaction entered into was the purchase of three vast
                        agricultural estates of| some 11,000 acres, which were secured At &amp; very
                        low price. This area was later on increased to about 15,000 acres, which the
                        company now holds. Under Mr. R. Lang Anderson's efficient supervision these
                        estates were gradually developed, canals and drains were opened, and new
                        buildings provided for the tellabeen. At present a large proportion of the
                        property yields splendid maize, rice, clover, barley, sugar-cane, and cotton
                        crops to the hundreds of the narrative families who cultivates the land,
                        partly as independent tenants and partly on the half share profit system
                        with the company. Thus, these four agricultural estates have always been the
                        backbone of the Egyptian Estates. </p>
                    <p>Anyone having the slightest idea as to the value of agricultural properties
                        in Egypt cannot deny that the lands owned by the Egyptian Estates are worth
                        to-day fully 60 to 100 per cent more than the purchase price, taking them on
                        an all-round average. We can positively state that in some cases small plots
                        of these estates are valued, and offers have been received by the company,
                        at 300 per cent, above cost price. It is also a fact that some of this land,
                        purchased at an average of £20 per acre, is now let on a three years' lease
                        at £5 28. 6d. per acre per annum, which proves that the land is valued in
                        proportion to the orop it yields- viz., at £100</p>
                    <p>As to building and suburban lands, the company's holding is very limited, and
                        the properties were not purchased at an exorbitant price, as has been
                        alleged. To give an instance : in spite of the financial stringency which
                        prevails in Cairo, the Egyptian Estates have this month sold a plot of
                        building land of about 1,300 square metres, in one of the suburbs of Cairo,
                        'at an average net profit of 24 per cont., and on the firm agreement that
                        the buyer builds at once on this area a four-storey house, which will
                        considerably raise the value of the adjoining land belonging to the
                        company.'</p>

                        Gorst the two points which struck him most were the great interest taken by
                        the notables and other rich Egyptians in elementary and technical education,
                        the large sums they were able and willing to subscribe for the promotion of

                        <p>Sir,- I have perused Lord Cromer's speech on Free Trade, which clearly
                            confirms the accuracy of your special service telegram, and I can only
                            reiterate the expression of unfeigned regret that sneb pronouncement
                            should have been made. To accuse Europe of having been bribed into
                            silence regarding England's position in Egypt and the Udah--for thus I
                            read bis Landship's Word was with all submission and Not of indiscretion
                            little likely either to find is voor with Pree Traders or to probate
                            converter amongst the ranks of their opponents.</p>
                        <p>But this by the way. My main purpose in troubling you again in to seek
                            enlightenment, which I have been unable to glean either from the text of
                            the speech itself or from such comments thereon, culted from the leading
                            London dailies, as were reproduced in the "Gazette."</p>
                        <p>Perhaps I should explain that I am neither &amp; Free Trader nor a
                            Protectionist, for the simple and I trust sufficient reason that I feel
                            myself incompetent, for want of adequate preparation, to arrive at
                            present at any definite conclusion. I fancy, however, that I have got as
                            far as to understand the meaning of those terms in their ordinary and
                            practical employment. A country, I apprehend is said to be Free Trade
                            which admits, generally, all imports duty free; whilst one that imposes
                            import duties upon substantially all articles entering its frontiers is
                            known as Protectionist. There is however a system which it is proposed
                            to establish in England partaking of the character of both Free-Trade
                            and Protection, a kind of "via media" whereby import duties shall be met
                            by retaliatory import duties and Free Trade by Free Trade. That is an
                            arrangement which, I understand is arrived at by tho Tariff-Reformers.
                            their policy may be right or it may be wrong. For the reasons given
                            above I am unable to express an opinion one way or the other. But that
                            the adoption of a fiscal policy which, upon the face of it, is in no
                            respect unfair, should excite the enmity of foreign nations to an extent
                            that would compel Great Britain to build many more Dreadnoughts and
                            necessitate an enormous increase in her present military establishment,
                            is a view which entirely passes my comprehension. On what ground could
                            Continental states and America, sur rounded as they are by a ring-fence
                            of Protection, reasonably object to our applying to their exports the
                            same tariff as they apply to ones ? And why should English statesmen
                            fear to adopt the good old German principle of "Wie du mir so ich dir
                            ?</p>

                        <p> Sir, One of the most significant
                            comments, which I have heard made in regard to Lord Cromer's recent
                            speech by persons conversant with his policy in this country, was as to
                            how his Lordship could reconcile his Free Trade principles with the
                            policy of handicapping the Egyptian cotton mills in order to protect
                            Lancashire. It is well known that the counterVailing duties were imposed
                            in order to appense Lancashire, whose prosperity might be safely
                            endangered if India and Egypt were allowed to turn out Manchester goods.
                            I have no doubt but that this policy was forced upon Lord Cromer from
                            home much against his will, but he had to do it and the result has been
                            | that Egypt's development as a manufacturing country has been

                            tafla has been going on for years unchecked, and it is very certain that
                            the day is not far off when the neglect will be seriously felt. What
                            will occur in Egypt when the cotton crop fails for want of nitrogen will
                            be a great contrast to the present prosperity. </p>
                        <p>Since I discovered certain berls of nitrates and phosphates, (and know of
                            others unknown to the officials) I have never had the least recognition
                            or sign of help, but the very reverse in placing these constituents
                            before the agriculturists, but hundreds of thousands are leaving. </p>

                            them exist in the country. I know it is only a question of time when
                            every nitrate and phosphate bed in Upper Egypt that can be found will be
                            worked and applied to the cotton crop, and the Government will much
                            regret their past actions towards ignoring the deposits and those who
                            have tried to place them on the market at a very large financial loss
                            through opposition. </p>

                    <head>The Seamen's Home</head>
                    <p>A most enjoyable concert was given on Monday night at the Seamen's Home at
                        Alex andria, the host of the evening and organiser of the concert being Mr.
                        Hilary Moss. With the Rev. H. Reid in the chair, the Rev. B. H. Blyth as
                        accompanist, Mr. Mobb as director general, and a goodly company or willing
                        and able contributors to an impromptu programme the discovery. things went
                        merrily and performers andаudience alike were pleased with their evening's
                        entertainment. Mr. Moas set the ball rolling with "The Young British
                        Soldier" and Mr. Donglas Allen followed with "The Balloymoney Conversazione"
                        which he sang with such humour that, like Oliver Twist, we all asked for
                        more. We got it too; a characteristic rendering of "I burst out laughing",
                        and we joined him in the laugh. Mr. Clarke was warmly applauded for be
                        rendering of "My Ola Dutch," and Mr. Hobsbaum's "Gallery and Boxes" was most
                        humorous and enjoyable. Mr. Pearoe Fill gave the audience a great treat,
                        assisted at the piano by Mr. R. Sanguinetti, who also gave a good selection
                        from the "Geisha", which was excellently played. Converting his massive fist
                        into the physiognomy of a dear little girl of six years, Mr. Pearbe Hill
                        amused us with a ten minutes' ventriloquial conversation and songs,
                        recitations, and the like and later in the evening he persuaded Mr. and Mrs
                        Sawdust to ring a duet, though the former was distinctly rude at times. We
                        cannot, however, describe the programme in detail, our space being curtailed
                        by pressure of news. Pleasure was derived from each and every item, and we
                        were very glad to see the number of sailors who volunteered contributions.
                        The Moss orchestra quintette from the "Seti" were excellent and several
                        other good items were given by men from Moss liners, and as a wind-up we had
                        a humorous sketch entitled "The Amateur Doctor". The evening was concluded
                        with a vote of thanks to Mr. MOBA and the performers and three cheers for
                        Mr. Blyth, who was indefatigable at the piano. In the interval between the
                        first and second parts of the programme tea and bans were served to the
                        men.</p>

                        of a five minutes' conversation ranges from 5d. to 7fd., and the annual
                        subscription amounts to £6. There is every reason to believe that in the

                    <p>(Aujourd'hui à midi)</p>
                    <p>Il est difficile de définir le caractère du marché. Les affaires font à peu
                        près complètement défaut par manque de vendeurs, dit-on, et cependant on
                        éprouve de l'ensemble un sentiment de lourdeur et de lassitude ; il serait
                        peut-être plus exact de dire que les acheteurs ne montrent encore que peu
                        d'empressement et que de leur côté les vendeurs de naguère rassurés en
                        partie par la reprise de ces derniers jours et par la baisse du taux
                        d'escompte, ne se hâtent plus de liquider, dans l'attente de plus hauts
                        prix.</p>
                    <p>Quoi qu'il en soit, les valeurs dirigeantes ont été généralement négligées à
                        une fraction minime de baisse. Ainsi l'Agricole revient de 7 29/32 8 7 7/8,
                        la National Bank de 20 1/2 à 20 7/16 et la Deltalight de 9 25/32 à 9 3/4.
                        Seule de cette catégorie, la Daïra demandée avance de 12 13/16 à 13 </p>
                    <p>On a également constaté une demande assez active en Nile Land qui gagne de ce
                        chef 1/4 à 8. Il parait même qu'elle aurait été traitée au Caire à un prix
                        supérieur. </p>
                    <p>Pour le même motif les Lots Turcs progressent de 159 à 160, la Banque
                        d'Athènes de 113 1/4 à 113 3/4, l'Urbaine de 3 3/8 à 3 7/16 et le Banco di
                        Roma de 102 à 103.</p>
                    <p>Au contraire, le Crédit Franco Égyptien rétrograde de 4 7/32 à 4 3'16 et la
                        Land Bank de 7 9/32 à 7 1/4.</p>
                    <p>En petites valeurs, les Markets perdent 6 pence à 24/-, les Dividendes Bière
                        du Caire 6 franes à 20, l'Ordinaire Khedivial Mail 9 pence à 22/-, les
                        Estates 1/8 à 13/32, ainsi que le Comptoir à 2 17/32; tandis que la Cassa di
                        Sconto gagne 2 francs à 45, la Delta Land 1/32 1 9/32, l'Aboukir 1 shelling
                        à 28/6, le fondateur Allotment 1 P.T. à 46 et la Port Said Salt 1 pence 1/2
                        à 12/6. </p>
                    <p>Sur le reste de la côte il n'y a pas de changements à signaler. On aura
                        observé que les fluctuations enregistrées sont assez inégales. Elles rendent
                        parfaitement l'allure du marché sui. vant la demande ou l'offre dont les
                        valeurs ont été l'objet </p>
                    <p>Comme tendance il n'est pas possible d'en donner une, sinon que la plupart,
                        haussiers et baissiers se tiennent dans l'attente des événements. Il faut
                        dire aussi que les capitaux manquent pour entraîner le marohe. </p>
                    <p>A la Chambre commerciale du Caire, Me Chalom demandait au tribunal
                        l'homologation du concordat préventif voté par les créanciers de la maison
                        Palacci fils, Haïm et Cie. Pour un certain nombre de créanciers représentant
                        la minorité, Mes Manusardi et Morpurgo s'opposaient de toute leur énergie à
                        cette homologation, s'appuyant surtout sur le fait que M.M. Palacci fils et
                        Cie avaient spéculé sur les va leurs de Bourse et sur ventes et achats de
                        terrains. "C'est là la cause de leur situation embarrassée; ils ne sont pas
                        des débiteurs malheureux, Le concordat préventif ne doit donc pas leur être
                        accordé". </p>
                    <p>A huitaine la décision du tribunal. </p>

                        <p>President Roosevelt's message to Congress confirms the forecast. He asks
                            for authority to remit the balance of the Chinese indemnity, and urges
                            American help for the educator of the Chinese in every practicable way,
                            especially to promote the coming of Chinese students to America. He
                            refers to the Japanese Exhibition of 1912 as an occasion of special
                            interest to all nations. He urges immediate generous provision for
                            American representation in view of the intimate Jap-American trade
                            relations and the warm friendship uninterruptedly maintained since
                            Japan's opening into Western intercourse and in view of her increasing
                            wealth and production which are regarded by America with hearty
                            good-will. He recommends the establishment of more docks and coaling
                            stations in the Pacific. </p>

                        <p>Deputy Luzatti, who has been several times Minister of the Treasury and
                            is considered one of the greatest European financiers, discussing the
                            financial crisis in the United States pointed out the defects of the
                            American banking system and suggested &amp; remedy. Professor Luzzatti -
                            advocates the convocation of an international conference aiming at the
                            substitution of the struggle for gold by the co-operation for an
                            equanimitous distribution of gold through agreements between the State
                            banks and the treasures of the different States. </p>
                        <p>This conference should examine and compare the regulations of the State
                            banks with the object of making them more adapted to prevent financial
                            crisis or mitigate them. Besides, considering that some European State
                            banks already exchange gold loans, the Conference should study the best
                            way of regular: ing these loans permanently and to the general
                            advantage. (Reuter) </p>

                    <p>London, November 29</p>
                    <p>The Money Market</p>
                    <p>At the time of writing it would certainly seem that the cloud which has been
                        banging over the money market during the past few weeks is lifting, and that
                        shortly we may see a return to something approaching more normal conditions.
                        The reports from America are now more optimistic, and it is to-day announced
                        that the subscription lists for the Treasury certificates of indebtedness
                        have been closed. This may of course, be interpreted to mean that the
                        objections which American bankers have levelled against this new form of
                        currency have induced Mr. Cortelyou to decide not to issue the whole of the
                        100 million dollars originally authorised, but the market bere seems to have
                        taken the other view that the improvement in the situation is responsible
                        for the closing of the list. In any case, the shipments of gold from London
                        show an appreciable falling off, and that, after all, is the most
                        satisfactory development from our point of view. As the shipments of
                        Egyptian cotton are now proceeding apace, it may be expected that your
                        country will call for the balance of the gold required in the near future,
                        and a cessation of the American demand will enable the Bank of England to
                        supply Egypt's needs without very much inconvenience. It is, of course,
                        still too early to give any reliable forecast of probable developments in
                        the States, as a very great deal must depend upon the public. If they
                        persist in boarding their money, the situation may again become critical
                        when the banks and other institutions recommence payments in cash. Our own
                        bank position is much improved, and events have all contributed towards a
                        lowering of rates. In the first place, the whole of the £4,860,000
                        transferred from Russian balances to Japanese credit, an account of expenses
                        in connection with Russian prisoners of war, immediately became available
                        after transfer, and was secured by the market for two months. Then, too, the
                        Bank of Pranoe have now somewhat modified their refusal to ship gold direct
                        to New York, and have released a quantity of American engles on the security
                        of commercial bills endorsed or the leading French bankers, Another
                        favourable point has been the release by the Indian Government of one
                        million of the five-and-a quarter millions held to their credit at the Bank
                        of England, and it is also satisfactory to know that a further substantial
                        quantity of Indian gold will be released if necessary The Bank return this
                        week shows an addition of alose upon two millions to the reserve. The sum of
                        one and a half million was received on balance from abroad, and about a
                        quarter of a million in coin returned from the country. The increase in the
                        reserve is therefore £1,870,000, bringing up the total to £21,785,603, as
                        compared with £23,613,809 in the corresponding week of 1906. The proportion
                        to liabilities is 4.05 higher on the week at 38.78 per cent. Last year the
                        proportion was 44.92 per cent. Demands for accommodation in connection with
                        the Stock Exchange settlement yesterday gave the money market a somewhat
                        harder appearance, and short loans realised 5 to 6 per cent. The Bank lent a
                        small sum for a week at 175 per cent. Three months' fine bills hardened from
                        37 to 6g. We are glad to note that Sir Felix Schuster, in his inaugural
                        address as President of the Institute of Bankers, on Wednesday, gave the
                        assurance that the committee of clearing house bankers appointed to consider
                        the question of gold reserves were determined to bring their labours to
                        &amp; successful conclusion, and that be was confident that a suitable
                        soheme, which would have the general co-operation of the banking community,
                        would be devised especially now that the necessity that had been once more
                        clearly demonstrated. He believed the general position in this respect all
                        over the country was already far stronger than ever before. When the
                        situation became more normal, he bad every hope that discussion would lead
                        to action, and that bankers themselves would take steps which would render
                        legislation or even talk ot legislation quite unnecessary. Legislation on
                        this question was to be avoided if it possibly could be We await the
                        publication of the committee's report with much interest. </p>

                    <p>The quotation for silver, after dropping on Wednesday to 264 for immediate

                    <p>The Stock Markets,</p>
                    <p>The improvement in the American position, and the belief that the
                        withdrawals of gold from the Bank of England will now soon cease, added to
                        the substantial improvement in the money situation which has already taken
                        place, has been reflected on the Stock Exchange, and the tone this week was
                        been much more cheerful. Business still continues to be restricted, but this
                        is of course natural, considering the fact that there must be for some time
                        to come a certain amount of uncertainty regarding the course of events in
                        the States. A crisis such as the one through which that country has been
                        passing cannot be got rid of in a day, and its effects upon the share
                        markets of the world will continue for some time to come, even assuming that
                        there is no no further set-vack. It is something however to see a tone of
                        optimism take the place of the gloom which has recently prevailed. Active
                        business can certain y not be expected until the turn of the year. The
                        feature of the week has been the strength of home railway shares. These have
                        been much in favour since the settlement of the dispute, and not a few wise
                        investors have taken advantage of the low prices to lock up &amp; quantity
                        of the better-class stocks. The home railway market has received a further
                        filly from the announcement of a contemplated working arrangement between
                        the Great Northern and Great Central companies, where: by, it is hoped, much
                        of the ruinous competition now prevailing may be curtailed, There is a very
                        unnecessary duplication of trains running to the northern towns, and the
                        proposed agreement should affect a considerable saving, and consequent
                        addition to the profits.</p>
                    <p>The monthly settlement has passed quietly, and no failures have been
                        reported. </p>
                    <p>Consols</p>
                    <p>The gilt-edged market has been much firmer, and Consoles at one time
                        yesterday were up to 82 ½ but closed at 82 ¾ , at which figure they showed a
                        rise off on the week. To-day they leave off at 82 3/16 </p>
                    <p>Foreign Bond</p>
                    <p>The Foreign market has been very steady on Continental support. The continued
                        buying of Russian Bonds has been a prominent feature, Paris having taken
                        large blocks of these during the last few days. The Fours yesterday left off
                        with an advance of 1 ¼ at 79 ½ , and Fives were higher at 88 ¼ . Last Friday
                        we quoted these Bonds at 76 ¼ and 86 ¼ respectively. Japanese Stocks have
                        also been well supported and are generally higher. Russian Fours have to-day
                        advanced ¾ and the Fives ¼ </p>

                    <p>A working agreement between the Great Northern and the Great Central railway
                        companies, which has been in process of negotia. tion for a long time past,
                        is now within sight of being realised. An arrangement has been drawn up, and
                        will be submitted to the shareholders of the respective companies in due
                        course. Expenses on the railways have increased at such an alarming rate in
                        recent years owing to the competition of the various lines running to the
                        north, that some means of cutting down these by mutual cooperation between
                        the companies has become absolutely necessary. </p>
                    <p>Americans</p>
                    <p>The tone of Americans has been less on settled since our last, and it is now
                        confidently hoped that the worst is over. It is of course, a matter of doubt
                        as to how long it will take to restore public confidence, and meanwhile
                        dealings will probably continue on a small scale. </p>
                    <p>This week movements have been interrupted by the Thanksgiving Day holiday in
                        New York yesterday, but on the whole prices are higher on balance. To-day
                        Americans have been restricted sending receipt of New York quotations. The
                        chief movement is an anadvance of 1 ½ in Canadian pacifies 149 ¾ . </p>

                    <p>There has been decidedly more doing in the Egyptian market during the past
                        week, and prices in most cases are very much better. The National Bank of
                        Egypt have been a good market, rising to 20 ½ , and Agricultural Bank, after
                        being very flat at 7, to have advanced rapidly to 7 15/16 bid. The
                        preference keep firm at 9 but the 3 ½ Debentures are still a bad market at
                        80-2. Daira Sanieh have also been in request, closing 12 ½ , which is an
                        advance of about on balance. The Deferred are unmentioned at 65-70. Delta
                        Land and Investment after being 1 ½ , were strong yesterday, and closed 1
                        1/4 -, with buyers about at 1, A. There are also buyers of Delta Preference
                        Bearer at 9 ¾ -10, but at present there is not much doing in these shares.
                        Khedivial Mail are no better on the dividend, and remain at 21/-8.
                        Corporation of Western Egypt have been dealt in at 8s. 9d. and 9/-s., and
                        Egyptian Estates are unchanged at ⅜ </p>
                    <p>Mining</p>
                    <p>In the early part of the week mining shares were firm, being helped by the
                        disclosure that the speculative position open, was very small. During the
                        past two days, however, movements have been dull and irregular, owing to
                        weakness in Paris, and several of the leading counters gave way. Yesterday
                        towards the close some of these were bid for, and recovered their earlier
                        loss. De Beers Deferred closed ½ better</p>
                    <p>The closing prices are as follows:</p>

                    <head>Desperate Case of Anemia</head>
                    <p>Saved by Dr. Williams Pink Pills</p>
                    <p>When one suffers from anæmia so acutely that synerpa supervenes, one's
                        condition is very grave, and in order to protect oneself from the inevitable
                        consequences, one needs a very powerful remedy. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for
                        Pale People is the most powerful remedy for anæmia. What, in fact, is
                        syncope! A momentary stoppage of the movement of the heart. If the heart
                        fails to resume its beating, then death ensues. Here is a case cured which
                        has been taken from a numerous collection. It will be seen that Mlle.
                        Snoeck, of 98, Rue de Gund, Oostacker-les-Gand, who was threatened with
                        syncope, has regained her health by taking </p>
                    <p>After having successively experienced all the symptoms---loss of appetite,
                        paleness, depression, a stifling sensation, giddiness, and general
                        weakness—I had frequent attacks of syncope. I despaired of ever curing
                        myself, for, although I had taken many remedies, I gradually became more and
                        more anæmic. Happily, I at last took Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, which saved
                        me. Thanks to this powerful medicine, I recovered good health when I
                        believed myself inexorable." </p>
                    <p>Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People are a cure for anemia, chlorosis,
                        neurasthenia, general debility, stomach ills, sick headaches, neuralgia,
                        sciatica, and rheumatism. </p>
