                    <head> THE FATE OF THE DUMA.</head>
                    <p>Seldom, if ever, in the annals of a great Empire in times of peso has such a
                        snccession of important events lean reported as*waa fent by Renter, and
                        published by ni» ou Monday,, concerning Russia. Bach item is pregnant with
                        most momentous possibilities, and taken to¬gether they present a terrible
                        pictore of the state of Russia at the present time. An Imperial Ukase has
                        dissolved the Dama, the building in in which it met being closed and guarded
                        by <cb n="6"/><!-- text missing --></p>
                    <p>We purposely refrain from commenting on 'the growing disaffection of both
                        army and \navy and the symptoms 6f revolt that are plainly to be seen in
                        both servioes, as we are at present concerned with the suppression of the
                        Dama—the representative bxly established only a short while back by the Tsar
                        in the of satisfying the political aspirations of his people. From the very
                        fir«t, in spitA of a restricted franchise and every possible obstacle that
                        coaid be devised Ur'obstraot its action, the Duma has proved itself a thorn
                        in the side of the Tsar aud his Government. Its re¬cent manifesto in favour
                        of the naturalisation of the land and the expropriation of landlords has
                        ptJved the last >traw, and we read that the deoiaion to d:ssolve the Dama
                        was oome to at a meeting of the Conqpil of the Empire at which, as might be
                        expected, Grand Dakes, Coart efti nals, General Trepoff, etc., weie pre- v
                        sent. To os it v^onId almost appear as if the Dama had oonrted disaster by a
                        premature ooarse of aotion. Land nationalisation is still a dream of the
                        fatare even in a country like England with its free institution*. To propose
                        it in a oonntry not yet emerged from auto¬cratic government looks very much
                        like at¬tempting to ran before yoU oan walk. The members of the l7omsr
                        however, have proved themselves by no moans deficient in ability, and
                        possessing as they do full knowledge of the sufferings and wants of the
                        agrionltorid Jom- monity and the argent necessity of drattib measures of
                        reform, they most have decided that they were folly jastifiod in issuing so
                        decisive a challenge to the Government "The King is dead, long live the
                        King.” Everybody understands'?tbe meaning of this phraie, which is so
                        generally used as to have become almost a proverb; when, however, the phrase
                        is applied in another direction it may have a different significance. At the
                        meeting of members of .the Parliaments of Europe and America which took
                        plaoe jn London onMondiy last, and, which was attended by Several members of
                        the Dama, Sir Henry Campbell- Badnerman expressed the King and Govern-
                        msnts' ‘sympathies with the objects of the oonfsrence and, allndicg to
                        suppreasion of the Dnma, exolaimed “The pama is dead, long live the Duma”
                        The Home Press seem to agree in describing the exp/eesion as a “daring” one,
                        the Conseivative organs cen¬suring and the Liberal papers praising it.
                        Seeing however, that the Tsar hassconvoked a new assembly for the 5th
                        ofrifcxt March, and that the European Press ubauimonsly ojudemn the
                        dissolution of the late one, we do not tbitk the Prim? Minister’s expression
                        ill-jadged. </p>
                    <p>'The fate of the Dams shows ns that, at any rate for the present, the
                        attempt to introduce Constitutional Government in Russia has fail-ed and
                        farther, that the reactionary party is still strong enough to compel the
                        Tsar to do its will. Itusria seema to be going from bad to aorse.; At the
                        olose of the late war some hope Jelt that the worst had passed and thiti
                        brighter era was about to dawn. But t j-day the sky is darker than ever, and
                        no oce can tell when, or in what direotioD, the storm will burst. As far as
                        oan be seen there is not one singleoapableleaderof the poople,and where in
                        the event of a revolution the guiding hand woald come from, that etloce
                        coaid restrain the passions of the populace, none can foretell. Kassia
                        to-day is the"YjouDtry of anarchy, honeycombed more than ever with secret
                        societies who oarry on almost with impunity au organised system of mniderj
                        and it is snpb a moment that the Tsar Jias cho an Yor the suppression of.a
                        body of pablio men aoting openly and oouragojnsly in'the face of the
                        reactionaries to whom he seems to have surren- lered himself, body. We may
                        admire his courage and devotion to duty in staying at home to face the mosio
                        instead of paying visits abroad ; but oannot shat oar eyes to the fact that
                        time as it passes reveals more and more his 'incapacity to rule and his
                        niter inoompetence to cope with the great origin that is evidently fast.

                        o^anextension of the Monroe doctrine. It is simply an attempt at a
                        rapprochement between the African Republics, with the object of bringing
                        a^bont an understanding on their oommeroial and Customs"relations, andj

                        S atev. Tne Hague Tribunal is too far off and, moreover, they wish to manage
                        their own affairs. Neither Canada nor the other British, French ai d Dutch
                        colonies, nor Venezuela are takxg part in this oongreas, at which the United
                        Staten will b$ve six representatives —two diplomatists, an ex Governor, and
                        three professors of law and history. Furthermore, in-order to em phaaize the

                        voyage round the oontiuentin an American man- of-war, which was to arrivb-at

                    <p>The Argentine representative intea’a to submit a motion to the cougreis
                        denying to the European as well as to Ameriosn States the right of
                        intervention in any American State or even the right of seiz:ng the Customs
                        for the recovery of private debts. ^The repre sentative of the "Gaulois”
                        objected that a State loan raised in France or in England was not a
                        privatejdebt. Mr. Van Polk insisted that is was, adding:—'.It is private
                        persons who have subscribed it Sc much the worse for them it they have
                        allowed themselves to be deoeived by intermediaries, or if, knowing the
                        conditions of the loan, they aooepted the usurious rates of interest wbioh
                        olearly io- dioated the risks' they ran. There have been veritable scandals
                        in this respect. If there are Republics which are badly governed we cannot'
                        for that reason agree to see them ruined in order to enforce the payment of
                        money which they haye not receive I in full.”</p>

                        trne that in Addition t/the diploma a certificate of good pondupt is
                        ne¬cessary from the applicant's Consol before a licenoe to praotise is
                        granted, but in many oases the Consol finds himself in the same difficulty

                        force for a period of over a year, and though at first it met with a
                        considerable amount of opposition on the part of the profession in general,
                        which was due to the faot that the provisions of the law were not thoroughly
                        understood, it was soon disoovered, after the law was pat in toroe, that it
                        pressed hardly on’y on those pharmacies Which were conducted in an irregular
                        manner, the suppression of which were as much in the interests of the
                        respectable chemists as in that of the general public.</p>
                    <p>There are at present 258 licensed chemists in Ejypt, and we learn from the
                        Pablio Health Department report, just issued, that daring the past year 285
                        inspections of the»e shops were made, 116 of which *^were carried, ont in
                        Cairo. The resalt of these inspections has beon that 4Oxohemists* shops have
                        been dosed, some by ordbr of the Coarts, and others By the proprietors
                        themselves to obviate further against them.</p>
                    <p>e inspectors in oarrying ont,their work have met with no opposition on the
                        part of the proprietors, and the Chief Iospeotor acknowledges the ooarteons
                        manner in which he and* his assistants have been received, and the general
                        desire on the part of the respect¬able members of the profession to oomply
                        in every respect with the law.</p>
                    <p>The law of 1904 forbids unqualified dispen sera to be in oharge of ohemists’
                        shops ;-tbat these unqualified men are being replaced by fnlly qualified
                        ohemists is proved from the faot that during 1995, 75% more ohemists have
                        been authorised to practise their profession in •Egypt than were authorised}
                        daring 1904. </p>
                    <p>Foraod Diplomat * ^</p>
                    <p>Very great oare has to be ekeroised in grant ing authorisations to practise
                        to persons pre¬senting* ohemists* diplomas from foreign schools, as daring
                        the last year three diplomas were found to be forged, and another applicant
                        was toned to be in possession of a diploma of a person who bad been dead for
                        a con¬siderable number of years ; in all cases where there is cause for
                        suspicion the applioaDt is questioned on matters relating to .bis
                        profes¬sion before he is allowed to praotise. </p>
                    <p>The Chief Inspector reports that since the new law has been in foroe there
                        has been a marked and general improvement in the ohe mists' shops throughout
                        the coaptry, that chemists'shops without qualified chemist* in charge of
                        them are almost unknown, and that the parity and freshness ot drugs in the
                        shops have much improved. The substitution of cheap imitations for new and
                        expensive drugs was discovered in 16 instanoss and legal pro¬ceedings were
                        taken in eaoh case.</p>
                    <p>A manual of instructions has been issued by the Department as a guide to
                        ohemists as to the best manner in which to arrange their shops and though
                        unofficial, and offered only as a recommendation, it has ■ been aooepted
                        /knd very largely followed.</p>
                    <p>Sale of Poleont.</p>
                    <p>The portions of the, law relating to the con¬trol cf the sale of poisons in
                        the country has not met with the same amount of sneoess.</p>
                    <p>Under the old decree there were 427 licen¬sed poison sellers throughout the
                        oountry j on the promu’gation of the new decree the old licences became null
                        and void*, and persons desiring to sell poisons in the oonntry bad to apply
                        for a new licence wbioh could ouly be granted under much more stringent
                        conditions; only 40 new licences ha've been issued under the new law, so
                        that it is reasonable to suppose that tbejllicit sale of poisons is taking
                        place on a large scale.</p>
                    <p>In the opinion of the Chief {nspeotor the reasons why so few persons apply
                        for the licence are the somewhat onerous conditions imposed on a trade which
                        does not bring large returns, the applicant being obliged to be a person of
                        respectability,able to read and write,and possess ing a knowledge of the
                        poison, etc., be desires to sell, and competeut to keep bis registers in a
                        regular manner and the obligation to provide a special room -in which to
                        keep the poisons. With regard to the detection of persons carry¬ing on the
                        illicit sale of poisons, Art. 27 of the decree gives the . right to’inspeot
                        drug-shops where the illioit sale of poisons is suspected, but as the sale
                        of poisons usually takes place in shops which are not drag shops, and often
                        in privite booses, this right is of little practical value. The right of
                        search under the Penal Code cannot be exercised as the offence is only a
                        contravention.</p>
                    <p>U»o of Opium.</p>
                    <p>It is not morally known, I imagine (says Sir H. Piuohing),. how very general
                        the use o. opium is among the native population, and as the poppy is
                        cultivated to a very large extent, especially in part* of Upper Egypt, the
                        control of the sale of this drag under present condi¬tions is almost
                        impossible. One may often see on mark it days the natiyi opium being
                        hawfielabont the streets by the fellaheen who bring it in from their fields.
                        It is therefore a question . whether a properly authorised and controlled
                        opiam trade woqld not be preferable to the trade as at present carried
                        orvand which is virtually uncqatrollable. The growth of the poppy will have
                        to be strictly controlled io the conntry if the Government desires to Jimit
                        the trade in this poison.</p>
                    <p>By the law of 1901 the'sale of opium is forbidden except by chemists on the
                        prescrip¬tion of a member of the medioal profession,</p>

                    <p>The following, extract from a despatch of Lord Cromer, contained in the White
                        Paper reoently issued, is ,of retrospective interest .— </p>
                    <p>In order to understand the somewhat oom- plioated question which has reoently
                        arisen in connection with the frontier of the 8inai Peninsula, some
                        knowledge of the'previous history of the claim of Bgypt to. administer the
                        peninsala is neoessary. </p>
                    <p>It cannot be doubted that Bgypt has.^M a matter of faot, been in possession
                        of this* territory for many oeotnriee. </p>
                    <p>A well-known Arab geographer and historian, who liked and wrote between 1274
                        and 1332 (El Malik Aba-el-Fida by name), described the .easttrn frontier of
                        Egypt as follows:— . </p>
                    <p>"Egypt is bounded on the east from a point on th? Bahr el Kalzam [Red Sea]
                        opposite Assouan to Izib Kosseir Kalztm [present 8uez], to the wandering
                        desert of the Israelites, and thenoe turns northwards to the Mediterranean
                        at Rafeh of 61 AtisL" </p>
                    <p>The position of Egypt in more modern times is based mainly on the Firmans of
                        J841, con- firming Mehemet Ali and. his heirs in the possession of the
                        Pashalik. A map showing the boundaries of the territories which were to be
                        henceforth regarded as Egyptian was drawn np in duplicate in 1841. One oopy
                        was retaine 1 by the Porte and oue oopy was given to Mehemet Ali. This map
                        is supposed to have been lost in a fire whrch destroyed a great part of the
                        Egyptian archives. The Turkish oopy is occasionally alluded to by the Porte
                        in oorroepondenoe, but, as far as I know, no one has ever seen it, and its
                        exist- ence appears doubtfal The Turkish Govern- ment olaims that, aooordiug
                        to this map, the eastern frontier of "the privileged Provinoe of Egypt” runs
                        from El Arisfi tozSaez. la addition, however, to the territory defined in
                        this map (and guaranteed by the Powers). Mehemet Ali was empowered to
                        administer the Sinai Peninsala and to hold the posts of Akiba, Dibbah (not
                        the same as Taha), Maelh, W^jh, in the Hedjaz, on the eastern ahorexof the
                        Go’f of Akkba. In this oonneotion it any bs objerved that, As already
                        stated, the Sinai Penimula had been administered by Egypt from of old ; and,
                        farther, that, as regards the poets in the Hedjiz, Mehemet Ali was already
                        in possession*of them, having saved Arabia for the Saltan by the suppression
                        of the Wahabi rebellion raised by Saond. The suppression of this rebellion
                        was oompleted by Ibrahim Pasha, eldest ion of Mehemet Alifin 1818. The grant
                        of the admi- nistration of Sinai was therefore merely a formal recognition
                        of the existing state of things. </p>
                    <p>The successors of Mehemet Ali continued to admindter this territory without
                        question until the accession of the present Khedive. Of this there is
                        abundant proof in the Egyptian arohives. </p>
                    <p>On the death of Tewfik Pasha and the acces- sion of his son, Abbas Hilmi
                        Pasha.(the present Khedive), a fresh Firman of Investitare was issued by the
                        Saltan. It was notioed that the text of this Firman differed from that of
                        for- met Firmans. The object ot this differenoe was apparently to exolnde
                        Egypt from the adminis- tration of the Sinai Peoinsnla. </p>
                    <p>After considerable difficulty and correspond- ence the then Grand Vizier,
                        Jevad Pasha, addressed a telegram to the Khedive, dated the 8th April, 1892,
                        aooording to which the Saltan resumed possession of the posts garri- soned
                        by. Egypt on the Hedja (or eastern) ooast of the Golf of Akaba, via,, of El
                        Wijh, Moelh. Dibbah (not to be confused with Taba), and Akaba. The telegram
                        ended this:— </p>
                    <p>"As regards the Tor Sinai Peninsula, the statue g_uo is maintained, and it
                        will be ad- ministered by the Khedivate in the sa^e manner as it was
                        administered in the time of your grandfather, Ismail Pasha, and of yonr
                        father, Mehemet Tewfik Pasha." </p>
                    <p>As the above-named posts in the Hedjaz, reclaimed by Turkey were of no
                        importance to Egypt, this telegram was considered satis- factory, and was
                        publicly read with the Firman of Investiture, of which it has always been
                        considered to form a complementary part. </p>
                    <p>However, in order to avoid any possible misoederdandirg as to tue meaning of
                        this telegram, I addressed a note, dated thesJ3th April, 1892, to Tigrane
                        Pasha, at thaSims Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs, stating that, a9
                        his Exoellenoy was aware, no alte- ration could be made in the relatione
                        between the Snblime Porte and Egypt without the oomentof Her Majesty’s
                        Government. I added— </p>
                    <p>The telegram from the Grand Vizier, whioh your Excellency has done me the
                        honour to communicate to me, makes it dear, however, that the Sinai
                        Peninsala—that is to say, the tenitory boanded to the east by a line running
                        in a south-easterly direction trom a point a short distanoe to the east of
                        El Ariah to the i head of the Golf of Akaba—ito oontinne to be administered
                        by Egypt. The fort oi Akaba, I which lies to the east of the line in
                        question, , will thus form part of the Vilayet of. the Hedjaz.” I </p>
                    <p>This note, which was sobrequeutly approved by L)rd Salisbury, was publi«hea,
                        with other correspondence respecting the Firman of Inves- , titure, and
                        oopiesof the latter and of the Grand Vizier’s supplementary telegram, were
                        offioial'y communicated to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. I </p>
                    <p>This point is of importance, as the elaim ot His Majesty's Government to be
                        entitled to objeot to any alteration of the situation thns created is
                        thereby fully justifhd. </p>

                    <p>On Monday night I Granatieri was given by the Lombardo operetta oompany at
                        .the New Abbas Theatre. As a mnsioal oomedy the play is very poor, the plot
                        being quite good, bat the masio ragged and unattraotive—at least, so it
                        seemed on.this oooasion. The part 6f Mimi was played very unsatisfac¬torily
                        by Signora Giaseppina Calligaris, who |bias got a harsh and uuplearing voioe
                        and seemed to imagine that an immutable grin, ample gesticulation, and
                        -heavy lurches aoross the stage were sufficient to create the rdle. Signora
                        Montis played the part of Dorotea frirly well though somewhat stiffly, but
                        the insignificant part of Beatrice was very well given by Siguora G.

                        Bernardo he proved no ex- oaption. The role of 11 Marchese di Large- trou
                        was well enttasted to 8»g. Piraooini, and both 8ignori Cnrti and 8aoohi
                        represented Odoardo and G orgio satisfactorily, though without particular
                        esprit. On the whole the play was poorly represented and fell flat before a
                        very small audienoe.</p>

                    <p>London, after all, to the bewilderment of Englishmen, is a cosmopolitan
                        city,</p>
                    <p>particu-larly in the matter of its drama. The American drama is an
                        established institution in the metropolis, the Gibson Girl one of the signs
                        of the timet The French and UermaD theatres are hardy Anunals ; the Yiddish
                        theatre, like the race which it seeks to please, and which to some extent it
                        typifies, a restless wanderer.</p>
                    <p>So often, however, does the Yiddish thea tre find à temporary resting plaoe
                        in the East End/ that its friends have been anxious to see it1 settled there
                        permanently.. Yiddish- loving playgoers have long cast envioQs eyes on New
                        York, which has its Yiddish as well as its Chinese theatre open all • the
                        year roand. A few years back, the Yiddish theatre was planked down on a so
                        called permanent* basis, in the Manor Hall, Hackney, but it dia not find
                        itself comfortable there. Moreover/ it was not the beat centre, and the
                        ventnie was short lived. Still, the The’pian wanderer found a home at fairly
                        regnlar intervale, at various halls and theatres in the East End, and was
                        always rapturously welcour- ed by the elder sons and'daughters of Judea.</p>
                    <p>Then, a year or so ago, a board went np on a vacant space in Commercial
                        read, blsz. ming forth the faht that here was to ri-e the Orient, a temple
                        of Thespis, with Eastern cupolas above and boards for the permanent rest ug-
                        plaoe of the wanderer beneath. Complete plans and illustrations of* the
                        bnildirg appeared in one or two papers—and then silence. But in anEglish
                        theatre noir at haod the Yiddish drama looks like sett’iog down.</p>
                    <p>For the present, the Pavilion Theatre, Mile End, jnst on th^feorder line
                        otthe Whitechapel and Mile End Constituencies, is crowded at every
                        performance. O-oe night the fare is his¬torical or sacred drama, the
                        next^modern farce, for the Jewish dramatic literature is all em¬bracing and
                        extensive. x And practically every piece is half operatic. All^Yiddish plays
                        are musical. To the denizens of the Ghetto music is one of the compensations
                        of life,and a Yiddish play without tuneful vocal numbers would be like a
                        wedding withoutjhe bridegroom.</p>
                    <p>An amazing literature is the 'Yiddish drama, it embraoee all perils and
                        qvery conceivable kind of play, and probab’y the most popular are the
                        oomedies. Home of them are farcical to the verge of burlecqae. many are
                        daringly satirical, and there are few oomio song) in the English language
                        that can equal the best of the Yiddish humorous ditties for subtlety.
                        English music hall songs have gained considerably in point by translation.
                        Yiddish, in a sense, is a polyglot language. Wherever it lacks a word; it
                        bonows from the language nearest at hand. Under the oiroomstances, it is
                        amazingly mobile, and its elasticity makes it a unique medium for the
                        conveyance of humorous sug-gestion and the portrayal of caricataje.</p>
                    <p>And just as Yiddish is the language of humour, so are Jewish sentiment and
                        tradition the vehiolee ofmelody. Quaintly plaintive are the melodies for the
                        most part, breathing the hope, the yearning, and the deathless spirit of the
                        Jew, and no matter how the theatre has echoed to the shoots of uproarious
                        laughter, a silence that is almost eerie will fall on the andienoe at tho
                        soond of the music that finds a quick response in the hearts whose
                        inner¬most secrets it voices so well. Jewish mosic is even more distinctive
                        than is Jewish drama, for it is purely native. The drama has not hesitated
                        to borrow, ahd there are quaint translations and adaptations^ Shakspeare,
                        Ibsen, and modern melodramatic, writers have all been bononred in this way,
                        and Mr. Sey¬mour Hicks coaid not better display the in- genoity which is
                        shown by Jewish an’lnrs in the introduction of songs.</p>
                    <p>With a repertoire eo vast and varied, and for the most part a change of
                        programme nightly, the. ta*k of the Yiddish actor is no light one. But
                        although the Jews have given of their best to the dramatic talent of more
                        than one Continent, the/ still retain sufficient to make the histrionic
                        versatility of the Yiddish theatre its most wonderful character istic.
                        Practically every actor and actress in the Yiddish theatre is a vocalist as
                        well as a mere mime, and the combination which is so rare elsewhere is here
                        quite ordinary.</p>
                    <p>But with the plethora of p'ays presented, the sadden deviations from the
                        programme and the inevitable changes in cast, the promp-ter is the personage
                        of the greatest impor¬tance in the Yiddish playlnnse JLt the Pavilion the
                        conditions are those of an ap-to date and modern theatre bat at the small
                        halli in London and the. provincesApre’sed into temporary service, the
                        arrangements have resulted in queer onrthcarstd ifl’epts. Buj a Yiddish
                        audience is indulgent, except to a .villain like Esterhazy, whose
                        representative in a Dreyfus play was mobbed, and generally accepts the
                        situations as additional opportn nities f>r laughter. And not infrequently
                        the actors who are favourite« take advantage of this good nature, with the
                        full permission of the audience.</p>
                    <p>This strange (tonne camaraderie between aadiencp and actor gave rise to a
                        most ludi- croas scene daring the performance of aSiberian play. The usual
                        crowd of miserable looking exiles were being driven across tho snowbound
                        steppes. An old man fell out of the ranks and begged piteously for water.
                        The crael soldiers replied with threats, curses, tbs lash. The hero
                        prote-tedf in vain. The comic rpan made asides, to relieve the tension. But
                        the audiet ce were in hissing not in laughing moodt and the come¬dian grew
                        desperate. His reputation was at stake. Hastily he jumped to the frqntof the
                        stage, and, seizing'dne ofthe' ffre Fqqkets there, he rushed to the fallen

                    <p>AN INTERESTING NARRATIVE?</p>
                    <p>A journey into the far interior of the African Continent is no longer
                        synonymous with a plunge into a mysterious unknown world. Virgin soil the
                        traveller may no doobt still find in the interstices of the ^network of
                        tra¬vellers* routes which cover the continent, but the meshes of the net are
                        grown comparative’y small and the work of sub division is constantly in
                        progress. If the pioneer explorer entered into possession of Africa in the
                        Nineteenth Century, the sarveyor may ba sail to have inherited thft
                        continent in the Twentieth Cen¬tury. This change in the eharaoter of African
                        exploration is oue of the chief impressions left by a perusal of the volume
                        in which, under the title “The‘Source of the Blae Nile,”. Mr. A. J Hayes has
                        given an acconnt of a journey through the Sadan to L‘ki Tsana, in Western
                        Abyssinia. European oivilisati m has not yet fastened its grip on Western
                        Abyssinia, but various explorers h id viaited Lake Tsana before Mr. Hayes
                        and his companions, and throughout the narrative the e is a feeling that the
                        travellers were never vary far out of touch with the outside world. K/eu on
                        the shores of the lake Mr. Hayes received by Abyssinian post a letter that
                        had been despatched from Port Slid on the day on which he left Cairo. Tfo
                        impression of the change brought in the condit:oos of African travel is
                        perhips height ened in the present instance by the otli )ial character of
                        the enterprise, the expedition a sarvey ronnd the shores of Lake Tsana, and,
                        in particular, to secure observations at the place where the Abai, or Bloe
                        Nile, issues from the lake.</p>

                        scarcely more than a collection of extracts. It is, perhapv^ little
                        disconcerting to find iu a narrative/ of travel that the traveller is
                        constantly oontent to convey his impressions and information by second hand.
                        But whatever may be thought of the method adopted by Mr. Hayes—and it has
                        .at least the merit of honesty—he has brought ' together a great deal qf
                        carious information, and the more unpirdonab’e therefore is the omission

                        avoid overcrowding .of the Railway goods-platforms dariog the Cotton season,
                        and the confusion necessarily resulting therefrom, the following egulations
                        will be enforced:—</p>
                    <p>’“1—All consignments must be separated from one another by a minimum
                        distance of two feet.</p>

                        is vaoant space, t.e., all stacking of subsequent consignments on the top of
                        these already existing will be prohibited. '</p>
                    <p>“4—Aunffioient spaoe most be left on each platform as a roadway for

                    <head> ThE-TURKISH NOVEL. A THING OF SHREDS AND PATCHES AND OF
                        POPULARITY.</head>
                    <p>The Turk has an insatiable appetite for bright brief talcs of love and
                        adventure, ,the roraautio and the supernatural ; and it may be justly said
                        that, with certain limitations, the short story has been brought to
                        perfection in Turkish literature.</p>
                    <p>The limitations—by which I mean the exist¬ing and apparently unalterable
                        conditions that prevent Tojkish fictional literature from tak ing a 'place
                        of unqualified excellence—are threefold. , •</p>
                    <p>Firstly, ^aJx^ori gio. The Turk haiever been an eft’uient and offen
                        enthusiastic imitator, but not a creator. He adapts from the Arabio, the
                        Persian, even from claftic Indian literature; or, on the other side
                        geographically, from the Hungarian, "the German-Austriar, the French,
                        altering names, characters and locality to fit his case. Of forty stories
                        which came to my notice during a recent Balkan journey, rt least thirty were
                        adaptations.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, as to veraoity. The ludicrous one sidedness of the Turk is well
                        koowp to travellers and stadewta. It oaused Mfltke to exclaim, several
                        decades ago, “The Turks write ii Hated bombast and call it history.” An
                        absurd partiality for anything Turkish, or at least Mps'em,.aud a grotesque
                        aversion to *aff?thicg E iropeanand Christian —hat, strange to say, not to
                        Jdws or things Jewish - lis- figure even the most poetical and brilliant
                        productions ofTurkish fictional literature.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, as to thd mode of distribution. This is twofold and, under both
                        forma, so utterly un-Buropean that it requires an effort of imagination on
                        the part of the Ocoidental who does not know Tarkey to grasp Che conditions
                        which obtain on the business-side of Ottoman literature.</p>
                    <p>The first distributing medium is the manuscript, which takes the place ofour
                        circulating library, and is the acknowledged means of oironlaticn. for
                        longer storied, say those of more than ten thousand words. Pro- tlwioial
                        soribes copy the prodactions of literary men, and often copy them*
                        beautifully, with scroll-work, illuminated borders and head¬ings, and the
                        artistlo monogtam work invented by the Arabs a faH thousand years ago. Theae
                        copies oircnlate principally among the ladies and ate passed on from harem
                        to harem. The copyist is also the bookseller or librarian ; the author
                        generally remains in the background, and often his name is not even
                        mentioned.</p>
                    <p>This is the reason why, with few exceptions, there are no famons names in
                        Turkish fiction, no Dickecs, no Thackeray. It is also the reason of the
                        often heard diotum of superficial observers that Tarkey has no
                        literature.</p>
                    <p>She has a vast literature, and a not incon¬siderable portion of it is of
                        splendid quality ; but most of it is anonymous. The author receives bis
                        remuneration from the eoribe, who, in most cases, simply buys the original
                        manuscript for a fixed sum and makes three or four oopies of it. There are,
                        however, some few authors, men of high class families, of wide
                        acquaintanceship, and of political and ctfioial influence, who can afford to
                        do without the middleman. They ate either their own scribes, if they are
                        sufficiently good penmen, exactly as the great composer Bach was his own
                        copperplate engraver, or they employ salaried copyists, and theD do their
                        own distributing, among families and households ..whore they have power and
                        social standing. 'These authors often sell their copies, instead of merely
                        lending them.</p>
                    <p>The second distributing medium is the pro-fessional storyteller. He is the
                        middleman for the short story, say anything between five hundred and ten
                        thousand words. From time immemorial the majori*y of the professional
                        reoitersfef Turkey have been 3yrians„who can declaim at will in Turkish, in
                        Arabic, in Syrian . (sio ?). Only those who have heard the reciter iu his
                        perfection in some .obsouTe, out-of-the- way cife, never mentioned by oar
                        Baedekers ynd od$ MurrayJ, never dreamt, of by Cook’s couriers and Stangeu’s
                        guides, can have an idea of his consummate skill, of bis power and passion,
                        of the wonderful, modulations of his voice, of the poetry of his whole
                        being, which shows even in the expression on bis keen, furrowed, bearded
                        face.</p>
                    <p>Up to ten or fifteen years ago the remunera¬tion of the professional reciter
                        came exclusively from the audience, in the shape of collections made during
                        the evening and far into the night.</p>
                    <p>But these Ool’.ections have fallen into discredit, since they, are a
                        disagreeable reminder of the cafe chantant in which the female singers and
                        dancers hand the plate round after each number. Thus, many reciters are now
                        paid a salary'by the cafe proprietor, and some of them command high wages,
                        since their art attracts {tin customers more effectively than, miro
                        fnaV^ooff-e or tea or lemonade. But whether be be salaried or dependent on
                        the guests’ bounty, it is to the reciter’s interest to keep Irmself well
                        supplied with striking novel^ ties. He is thns the beB\ indeed practical#
                        the only client and patron of'the authored ( à it J, short. storieA,
                        whosoprodoce he buys in nxHtj — x cases outright with -the manuscript. Here,
                        I again, the author is hardly ever mentioned. I: have listened to nearly a
                        hundred short tales J read by public reciters from manuscripts, and in only
                        one instance can I recall the name of , the author being given,-and that
                        appeared to ' be solely because the writer was also a states¬man well known
                        to the. a« dience, though not to nfo.</p>
                    <p>The Turk is notoriously ^tr ci torn and secretive, the Syrian donbly sb, and
                        it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable data as to an author’s
                        remuneration. But in one case, at least, I succeeded in penetratiug the
                        secret of the trade, and that was the case of ‘ a novel<cb n="2"/>of forty

                        that the ordinary Osmanli’s praotioal ignorance of sexual love and
                        court¬ship must be a grave di qualification in regard to fiction, because in
                        the Oco:dent love is its all-absorbing theme. ‘A Turk sees his wife for the
                        first time on his wedding day ; carriages are arranged by the fathers. How

                        Yet, somehow, it does ; for the Turk can transcribe, transpose, adapt,

                    <head>EGYPTIANS AND THE RECENT CRISIS.</head>
                    <p>ATTITUDE OF THE COPTS.</p>
                    <p>“A Native of Upper Egypt” writes :— Thb Tabah crisis has taoaht the English
                        in Egypt terrible things, if I may be allowed to use such an exoresdion.
                        Most of them thoughf that the Moslem population would be either neutral
                        oFfriendly towards the British Occupa-tion. This view was not without
                        reason, for the A bglo Egyptians could not help thinking that the Moslems
                        would prefer the present prosperity and freedom to the old misery and
                        misrule.</p>
                    <p>Why Uiould the whole oivilizad world testify to the taot, goodwill,
                        Imperialistic statesman¬ship, and mighty power of the English nation and the
                        Moslems'of Egypt testify to the reverse and also say that the Sultan was
                        "victorious’’ in the end and in the beginning be was "in the right” and the
                        English were '.‘in the wrong” ?</p>
                    <p>I know that it is very hard for a European, who as a rule does not know the
                        "ins” and outs of the Moslems, to believe these facts. But I as a Copt
                        confess that it wou’d have been quite impossible for me to imagine that the
                        Moslems and their press could have taken the side of the English or have
                        been neutral.</p>
                    <p>Now, why did they behave in such detestable manner towards the English who
                        have done so much for Egypt? By far the chief reason is that in their heart
                        of hearts they firmly believe that religion and politics are inseparable,
                        and this strong belief, together with their bigotry, blinds them completely
                        to any diplomatio taot, national right, or states¬manship. Bat can we,
                        Christians, blame a people who are true to their religion and to live up to-
                        the teaching oi Mohamed, whom they passionately love.?</p>
                    <p>The second reason, thoagh it cannot be com¬pared with the first, is worthy
                        of note. It is the attitude of the Anglo Egyptians towards the natives in
                        general. This snbjeot has been disoussed exhaustively, and especially in the
                        Egyptian Gazette” of 28bh January 1905, and unfortunately with no apparent
                        resalt. The Egyptians are a very sentimental people and it is a pity that
                        the English should ignore this faot. To think that the modern Egyptian can
                        be ruled by' anything except sentiment is a mistake.</p>
                    <p>Having considered one section of the natives with regard to the Tabah
                        crisis, let ua. con¬sider the other section, viz., the Copts. For although
                        the latter are only about one million yet they are the friendly rivals of
                        the Mos¬lems iu almost every ephere of life, and deserve nearly as mnoh
                        consideration as the Mohamedans. During the orisis, the native Christians,
                        who are vouched to be the purest Egyptians, an I their Press spoke iu a vqry
                        friendly manner towards the English and discountenanced the idea that the
                        present Anglo-Egyptian Government should be chang¬ed and the Tnrkish rale
                        resumed. It is a well known fact that the Copts have always been grateful to
                        the English at heart (for obvious reasons they cannot show their gratitude
                        openly) and when some Coptio churches offer thanksgivings at the anniversary
                        of the British Occupation, there oan ba no doubt as to the frieodly feeling
                        towards the English.</p>
                    <p>May we not hope that this friendship will be reciprocated by the Anglo
                        Egyptians ?</p>
                    <p>Young Copts who are working for their degrees and diplomas here in England,
                        never dream of joining tha Government servioe when they return home, while,
                        on the con trary, young Moslems in similar oooapabions never dream of
                        anything else.</p>
                    <p>This is because every one oi the former is "too old a bird to be caught by
                        chaff” and indeed sometimes even “chaff” is denied him.</p>
                    <p>Bob the latter become, in a very short space of time, Moudire, Wakeelp,
                        Advisers’ secre¬taries, chief engineers, etc.</p>
                    <p>There is no need .for me to repeat the disadvantages, stated in my letter to
                        the Gazette” of the 8th January 1906, under which the Copts have to
                        labour..</p>
                    <p>They never grumble at anything for the simple reason that thej^ have been
                        subject to more or less persecutions under the Mos¬lem rule, for the laat
                        thirteen centuries or so, and are, as it were, used to it. But when it is
                        remembered that we are in the 20th centary and'Egypt is ruled by Christians,
                        one is tempted to think that we Copts are not better off than we wore , in
                        the tenth centary.</p>
                    <p>It is childish to- say, as many natives do, that the English do not put the
                        Copts op the same footing as the Moslems because they are afrrid of
                        displeasing the latter. I think the one thin$ that will please the Moslems
                        is that the English will resign their supremacy and rale in favour of the
                        Saltan.</p>
                    <p>Il is a well-known faot in E’ypt that the native communities have become of
                        late years on better and more friendly terms than ever they were before, and
                        therefore it is most probable that disfavouring the Copts will increase the
                        unpopularity of the English with the Moslew population.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptians do not know of any reason which justifies such an attitude
                        towards one community, and disoonntenance the conti¬nuance oi suoh
                        unwarrantable disfavour.</p>
                    <p>I need hardly say the moral of this case deserves the attention, of the
                        Anglo-Egyptians, and the sooner an understanding is established between them
                        and the Copts the better it is for Egypt.</p>
                    <p>That the English are fond of peace and goodwill is best illustrated by the
                        “Entente Cordiale” with France. Suoh an “Entente’' can be easily established
                        hetwen the Anglo-Egyptians and the Copts if the former wish it. And if a few
                        Englsihmen , chosen by Lord Cromer, were to meet the Coptio National Council
                        at Cairo, then the chances are that in two Sittings they Would COme to a
                        happy issue.</p>

                        the globe before man came into existence, the materials brought to light by
                        the excavator in the shape of pottery, tools, and weapons, contempora¬neous
                        inscriptions, and the like, enable the archaeologist to reconstruct the
                        history of civilizQdman.</p>
                    <p>Archaeology, in faot, takes op iho history of the past where geology lays it
                        down, and supplements the history of natare with the history ofhoman
                        intelligence.</p>
                    <p>Infinite Mischief done by Ignorance.</p>
                    <p>The scientific exoavator is bound to be an arobicclogist, just as the
                        arob(eulogist ought to be a soientifio excavator. The practical work of
                        excavating ought to be accompanied by a training in scientific methods, by
                        the power of understanding and appreciating indaotive evidence, and by a
                        skilled and observant eye.</p>
                    <p>It is not enough to have turned over the soil of an anoient tumulus in the
                        haphazard fa«hion-of the olden "sntiqnarigs.” or to have disinterred the
                        monuments of some early oirili- sationSp order to fill with thenr the rooms
                        of a muuenm; "suoh methods of excavation have, unfortunately, been only too
                        prevalent in the pzat, and,have done infinite misohief by destroy¬ing
                        evidenoe which the exoavators had not enough soienoe to oomprehend or
                        reoord.</p>
                    <p>The Excavator's Happy</p>
                    <p>Hunting Ground</p>
                    <p>The archaeologist has constant rekson for regretting that excavating began
                        before the modern science of archeology was born.</p>
                    <p>Soientifio exoavation had its rise in northern Europe; then followed the
                        excavations of Dr. Schliemann and'others in Greek lands; and fioally the new
                        soienoe was, systematised and perfected in Egypt, where the olimate and sand
                        have preserved the relics ooantless gene¬rations, and the British ocoapation
                        has given faoilities to the excavator which it is difficult to find
                        elsewhere. The methods of excavating thus brought to perfection in Egypt are
                        now being imitated in other parts of the world, more especially in
                        Palestine, where the work of the English and Austrian explorers is at last
                        revealing to av, not only the history of of Israslitish Canaan, but also
                        that which the Israelites oonquered.</p>
                    <p>Egypt is. however, above all other countries, the oxcavator's happy banting
                        ground. In lah^where rain and frost are practically unknbwo,_the prod acts
                        of man’s art and ih dastry perish only by the hand of man. The monuments of
                        the pioneers of civilisation some sijx or eight thousand years ago lie side
                        by side with the later productions of the twentieth century, one almost as
                        fresh as the other. Last winter, while exoavating at Gehel Silsila, I came
                        across the rude figure of a giraffe ham mered ont by a flint on the snrfaoe
                        of a sandtone rock (and therefore going back to'the Neoli t)fic age), the
                        outlines of nhich had been worn to the oolonr of the rook itself.</p>
                    <p>Over it—abpnt four thousand years ago— an Eleventh Dynasty inscription had
                        been ont with a metal tool, the oharaoters of which still looked fresh. Foar
                        thousand years bad made hardly any appreciable difference in their
                        appearance. Looking at the two memorials of the vanished oentnries one could
                        thns form some idea of the enormons antiquity to which the primitive drawing
                        must reach back. It is only iu Egypt that we cau folly realise the antiquity
                        of civilised man.</p>
                    <p>Fragment of a Lost Gospel.</p>
                    <p>And it is in Egypt,, perhaps rpore than any¬where else, that it is always
                        the unexpected which rewards the labours of the excavator, and lends to his
                        work somewhat of the excite ment of gambling. We searoh for one thing, and
                        find another which ms/ happen to throw a wholly new light apon the past. At
                        Gebel Sikila, for example, I was primarily engaged in digging for tombs ;
                        the,tombs proved1 to be cf secondary importance, but what I actually came
                        across were the remains of a temple of the Eighteenth Dynasty, the very
                        existence of which had been previously unknown.</p>
                    <p>It is nqt^ however, only the Egypt of the Pharaohs whose history, when
                        scientifically in¬terpreted, has been preserved in the friendly soil.
                        Christian and Mahommedan Egyp| are there as well, and dnrieg the last few
                        years we have learned that if we are to recover the</p>
                    <p>towns, with the speoial purpose of disinterring the fragment*) of papyrns
                        rolls with which they are filled, and thoasands of sooh frag¬ments, mostly
                        G.eok, and many of them belonging to literary works, are now in Eog- land.
                        Among the fragments discovered on the site of Oxyrhynohns are the famons
                        Logia or Sayings of Christ aronnd which there has been so much learned
                        theological disonssion.</p>
                    <p>Last winter a vellum leaf was found on the Eame site, containing what may
                        prove to be a fragment of a lost gospel of the latter part of the seoond
                        century. As it identifies the ‘ high priests” with the Pharisees, it cannot
                        be earlier. But, like the older Logia. it is an earfe’fc of what we may hope
                        still to discover.</p>
                    <p>The tradition of the early planting of Chris¬tianity in the Greek oities of
                        E >ypt has been folly cot finned, and as excavation proceeds there is no
                        reason why other fragments of the primitive Church may not be disinterred,
                        including, it may be, a copy of the Gospel of St Mark itself. One of the
                        latest German finds is the work of a Gnostio heresiarch against^whom St
                        Iremcas wrote, which shows that in spite of modern oritical doubts Irentcas
                        has correotly reported the doctrine and meta¬physical system of his
                        opponents.</p>
                    <p>Arohceology supports the Bible.</p>
                    <p>Bat Egyptian excavation has been casting light opon the later books of the
                        Old Testa¬ment as well as upon the books of the New Testament and the
                        iiteratare of the early Church. Two years ago a series of very oom plete and
                        important Aramaic papyri wa« discovered at Assouan, which I am at present
                        engaged in editing.</p>
                    <p>They are all carefully dated, and belonged to a colony of Jews—the grand
                        children or great grandchildren of the Jews who njigrated into Egypt with
                        Jeremiah—whq zIi^d at Assouan and Elephantine in the time of Xerxes I. and
                        his two snccessors.^Theee Jews were already the bankers and money-lenders of
                        the place, afitLheid a"good deal of property * there. The papyri throw, a
                        lat^e amount of light on Jewish law and ocslom, more espe-1 oially in the
                        matter of marriage; they also explain the origin of the so-called Biblical
                        Chaldee.</p>
                    <p>It was the official Aramaio of .the western half of the Persian Empire, as
                        spoken and written by tfie Jews'. The names Inrne by the Jewish oommunity,
                        it is interesting to note, are exactly those which we fiod in the p'ost-
                        exilio hooks of tin Old Testament. Other similar documents of Jewish origin
                        may be expeoted to turn np, now that attention has been directed to them.
                        This winter, for in- stanoe, I obtained one whic£ contains the accounts bf a
                        Jevpsh trader, and is about a century and-abalf later than those found at
                        Assouan. > *</p>
                    <p>But the archeological revelation of Egypt is not as yet half exh lasted. Tke
                        future has discoveries, in store for ns of which we oannot at present even
                        dream. The age of the “sub¬jective” dissection of literary works, and the
                        attempt to rewrite history with the help of philology and literary tzot is
                        now over, at all events so far as the scientific student of the past is
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>If we are to discover the history of the past, and to tebt the traditions of
                        it which have come down to ns, it must be by means of arohceology, and of

                    <p>ARTILLERY OFFICER'S INTERESTING RIDE</p>
                    <p>Ho was resting by a country stile, and his bicycle—upon which he tarned now
                        and again an atl>ctiouate, if somewhat sunburnt, glance —lay beside him. I
                        asked him for a light and, sitting down to rest, we fell into casual
                        conver.e. .</p>
                    <p>' Have yon two oome tat ?” said I. "You look n'ealy travel worn.” .</p>
                    <p>Fairly/’ fit replied, as he b’ew a clqnd of Egyptian smoke into the sunny
                        air, and lazily regarded the dainty wreaths twisting and turning ere thejr
                        were for ever lost in illimit¬able spacn; "we have oyoled more or less ever
                        . e/hce we left the ship at Port Said.”</p>
                    <p>V^Well done/’ I said, ' that sounds interest-ing. l\wish you would tell me
                        about it. for you must have had a wonderfully interesting ride.</p>
                    <p>But what made you think of it ?” .</p>
                    <p>"I don’t kuow,” he replied. "I hail had a long spell of it in India. I am in
                        the Gunners, yoa know, and ever since I was at the ’shop’ I have been fond
                        of cycling, and the idea struck ms one day that it would be possible, and
                        certainly interesting, to cycle home from Egypt. It was awfully jolly
                        getting to Port Said. Just as we steamed in the band of the Twrb!e straok up
                        the National Anthem, and at first we thought it was in our honour, until we
                        were told it wate to celebrate the Priuce of Wa'es's entry into Cairo at
                        that moment. Well,</p>
                    <p>1 left the steamer and transhipped to the Russian boat Cornelio, and, set
                        off for Jaffa.</p>
                    <p>"Tell I said, know.”</p>

                    <p>ni at the pro^peot pf what even the na tive§ of Tripoli described t % a
                        bridle path ‘200 miles long that I resolved to take steamer to Smyrna, where
                        I discovered A small oolony of relatives with whom I spent six very ploasant
                        days. Ephesus was very interesting, and also the spot dreamt about by the
                        German peasant girl - the origin of a new sect in the it 0. Choroh. -</p>
                    <p>‘Well, cnce again I was doomed to dis-appointment as regards bicyoling to
                        Con-stantinople. A perfectly organised band of brigandj watched over Smyrna.
                        They, would know I had rich relatives in the town, and the rich relatives
                        themselves dissuaded me from the attempt fiosribly from kindness” he
                        doubtfully murmured—-^'possib.y becaase they smelt a big ranaomr^which they
                        might have boon at-ked to pay had I been cryptnred, and so I went by sea to
                        lstambul, as Con¬stantinople is called in tl^at pirt of the world. At
                        Constantinople I had great trouble with the Customs Honse people. They
                        fussed about the carefully packed hold all until human nature could stand no
                        more - at least, my human nature conldn’t. In such moments one forgets all
                        about one’s Turkish and Arabic, aud goes back to good plain o’d English.
                        Th*y understood at onoe, and one regretted one’s former forbearance.</p>
                    <p>"But they were to sorry—the bicyole could not be got through. It was Friday,
                        the Mohamedan Sunday, and on that day no self-respecting Tnrk dreams of
                        working. This was the last straw. So, snatching it up, I carried the bioycle
                        a yaelf through gaping and terror stricken r.tfi rials to the office of the
                        Director of Customs. A few words about British subjects and the British
                        Ambassador and a mejbidie (or Turkish dollar) under the table cleared things
                        op.</p>
                    <p>' Here in Constantinople some of my widely- spread relatives took charge of
                        me. I was wondeofuilyTmpresaed) with St.Sophia, the most wondffrful building
                        I/have ever aeon, but its majZtio beauty is sadly mfcrred by its very
                        sonhcLaurr-oOudiugs. I trained fjrom Constan¬tinople to Belgrade, and there,
                        to myjiy, I again mounted my little friend he’e. But even when riot actually
                        ridirg on the bicycle I found the . machine helped to make the journey
                        wondei fully easy. Y HI seo, there were no worries about servants, /orters;
                        handbags, or advance luggage. I tied a i my lnggage on to the bicyole, aud
                        then tbo" all travelled in one. One foals absolutely si f-contained, and
                        able to go anywhere or sa'i anything; not tied down to gd any roo.e,- or
                        stay in any particular place. As I wa; not .cycling for a wager, or against
                        time, A consulted only my own convenience ami pleasure. Afte/ the first 100
                        miles in Palestine, whan the biko was really tesled to thn fall, I had no
                        misgivings about its holding out. I know that, bar accidents, which, after
                        all, a care¬ful rider can often avoid, the thing would' carry me through,
                        and it did—splendidly. Even unavoidable accidents, such aa punc¬tures, were
                        usoaliy very we'oome, as I found great relief iB * using ar.other set-of
                        muscles. In the ordinary course of events I never got pft until 1 was
                        fairly* ccmpelled to do so. Getting on and eff over my luggage was quite an
                        acrobatio ft at, and meant mounting by the pedal, aid throwing the right
                        foot well over.</p>
                    <p>I remember in Palestine a clowd once collect¬ed, and the village hero wanted
                        tomonnt the strange machine. He had been to Beyrout, and seen the thing
                        used, and so thought he knew all abont it. I longed to let him try, and see
                        him hurt himself in front of all his admirers, bxf the chance 6f his doing
                        some damage was too grSat, so I retired gracefully with the mach'ue, puffing
                        oat smiles and Arabic.</p>
                    <p>"The only objection to the trip from my point of view was being alone. It is
                        not always possible to find a'.companion for so long a journey and not b^ing
                        made of the true ex¬plorer stuff I iretfd to get very tired of my own
                        company. At the same'time, I am boond to own that there were plenty of
                        little occur¬rences to relieve the monotony. For instance,</p>
                    <p>I remember passing through Strasbourg, and oycling through long lines of
                        soldiers wbo were waitir g for the Emperor^ and who cheered me heartily—whe*

                        and Arabic and Torkiah worse than useless, greatly amused me. la one town—
                        Mitowitz, a typi¬cal Hungarian town—I wauted bam, but not a soul know what I
                        meant until a happy inspiration dawned upon me, aud I roughly eketched a
                        pig, especially outlining his hams, and pointing dowu my throat.</p>
                    <p>"A curious’thing happened in Germany one day. *1 was riding from
                        Schlettstadt to Worms when I ran up against a large hay cart which refused
                        to move out lof the narrow road to let me pass. I got past finally andtild
                        the carter what I thought of Irm in scraps of three languages. A mile
                        further on I had apunoture, and the carter and his pals cgxne op and
                        threatened to be trouble ornn. Ttfey returned ray language with interest.
                        However, I think even a German is cased when Tan appears to . ise Iris

                        its people, its flowers, its cities, its bills and valleys, its whole
                        characteristics, when you bicycle leisurely through-it. In this way I came
                        to know and like the people of Southern Europo—everyone, that is, barring
                        the larkish official. They are very kind, and one is very ready to forgive

                    <p>‘H ell, to put it briefly, my journey was as follows Fort Said to Beyrout by
                        ship; Beyrout to Tripoli by bicycle ; Tripoli to Smyrna and Constantinople
                        by sea-; rail to Bslgrade, and then cycled from Belgrade to Vnkovar, where I
                        was stopped by floods, and so on to Trieste by train. From Trieste I
                        bioyoled .to Brescia, touching Venice and Verona :-and trained over the St.
                        Gothard to Gosohenen ; from Gosohenen I bicyoled to Worms, and then took a
                        river steamer to Cologne, from whence I trained to Ostend, taking the boat
                        to Dovfcr, whence I am bicyoling.to Hastings, as you see. The longest run
                        was from Sohlettstadt to Worms—125 miles in one day. My most difficult was
                        my ride in Palestine, where I was only able to ride my bicyle for ten miles
                        oat of thirty-five It was hard going, that German ride, as I did the 125
                        miles inside of thirteen hours Coming throngh the St. Gothard Tunnel in the
                        tram a box fe’l on the back wheel of my bike, and buckled it up, but by
                        stamping and tightenmg the'spokes judiciously I succeeded in making it
                        revolve without touching the fork and I was amazed to find it carried me all
                        the way down the mouutain pass, and finally into Mulhaosen, the only
                        disadvantage being an undue strain on the spokes. I aged to spend about five
                        minutes at night and fifteen minutes in the morning oiling and cleaning and
                        going over the machine. I was delighted to find that none of the parts
                        worked loose or reqmrod lightening, ». jn 80m0 maohiDM Ihis I attnbntod to
                        cvefnl tbonght on the p»rt;of the mannfaotnrars. I thiok the very lightness
                        of the machine often served it, as there was no dead metal, so to speak, to
                        accu¬mulate energy in breaking itself.”</p>
                    <p>1 rather wonder yon didn't bioyole from Constantinople to Belgrade," I
                        remarked “I always think that part ofBurope is so interest- >ng-</p>
                    <p>"So it is,” replied my friend, bat to tell yoa'the truth I did not oare to
                        start on a hundred mile3 run over infamous roads only to get’nto the train
                        to avoid the troubled area of the Macedonian revolt. I enjoy ri8ks while the
                        odds are even, but when things come to two to ore on the brigands the
                        sitnation beoomes absurd. Servia is a very uninteresting country' and their
                        Customs a hotbed of extortion, and eo I aned off, and started bicyoling from
                        the borders of Hungary.</p>
                    <p>“Of coarse, what interested me more than anything, perhaps, were tha
                        glimpses I got into national, oharaoter. In Syria I always fonnd Ihe people
                        pleasant, and obviously amused and interested with the onwonted spectaole of
                        a youDg mm travelling alone>rith his bioyole, a maohine very few of them h
                        ever seen. In Southern Europe they were, as havejsaid, good-humoured
                        sooundrels who preciated the novelty of such an enterprise. Germany only too
                        often I fonnd them apt to he surly and ill-natured. I remember wr amu¬sing
                        incident which occurred when I Arrived in Schlettstadt. I went into an
                        hotel. The mrnager and some ladies were seated there drinking beer in the
                        dining-room. It was a small plaoe, but I politely asked them if they could
                        give me a bed.</p>
                    <p>Mein hoste remained seated, and sulkily replied in the -affinaative/-1 left
                        him one minute, while I wont to put my lamp out ; i and on my return,
                        finding he had made no movement, I told him that as he could not be
                        Ojmtiionly polite he might keep his precious room to himself. Then the fun
                        began. He oould not afford to let an E lgli^hman—.especially a globe
                        trotter—go elsewhere. First he pressed me to stay, and thon, finding that I
                        was ada¬mant to his entreaties, he turned savage, and I left him, greep with
                        rage, on the doorstep with his three daughters. In Milan the secretary of
                        the Touring Club was very interested in my tonr and in my dear little
                        Rndge-Whitworth Aero Special, and he helped me a great deal with maps and
                        road books.</p>
                    <p>The whole j mrney remains like a bsantifol dream in my mind. Its memory'will
                        be with me all my litp. There is nothing so'delightful as wheeling along
                        those sunlit roads, with ail the oloud scenery round and about one, and a
                        new oonntry opening itself op to one every minnte.I cannot advise a better
                        mode of spend¬ing a holiday. And it is snob a wonderful break in the long
                        voyage from India. You oan send all yonr heavy baggage home by sea, and
                        reserve just enough very light material, as I have already described to
                        you,', which oan bs fastened on your machine. Take your money by moans of
                        oirculat notes, anri always have a supply of compressed J^qd softie'ent to
                        last you fourteen days. Well, I must push on to Hastings, and then I and my
                        little bicyole will be at test.”</p>
