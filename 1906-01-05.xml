                    <head>THE EUROPEAN OUTLOOK.</head>
                    <p>That delicate equipoise, known as the balance of power, has been sadly ont of
                        gear since the downfall of autocracy in Russia. The most striking example of
                        the new state of things in Europe has been the action of Germany in Morocco,
                        and the gloominess of the outlook is fully reflected in one of the telegrams
                        which we publish to-day. Therein we are told that a feeling of apprehension
                        prevails throughout Europe ou the eve of the Morocco Conference, which
                        begins this morning, and that the tone of the Spanish and Italian Press is
                        most pessimists, while even the Berlin newspapers show an unwonted
                        uneasiness at the rumours of Germany's military preparations. It is
                        ridiculous to sneer at these forebodings, since the recent publication of
                        the French Yellow Book on the Morocco question has shown to the world that
                        Germany has within the last few months deliberately risked a most terrible
                        European war on behalf of imaginary rights in Northern Africa, the exiguous
                        nature of which she had already acknowledged. The history of the relations
                        between France and Germany over the Moroccan agreement leave no doubt that
                        the latter Power daring the month of June last was deliberately presenting a
                        pistol to the head of its western neighbour, and that the peace of Europe
                        was gravely endangered without the shadow of a justification. The papers in
                        the Yellow Book begin in March 1931, and show that the anarchy in Morocco,
                        the repeated frontier outrages, and the general ferment on the frontiers of
                        the French possessions in North Africa were producing an absolutely
                        intolerable state of affairs. They show also that on June 23 in that year M.
                        Delcassé admitted to Prince Radolin that France, as mistress of Algeria and
                        Tunis, was bound to <cb n="5"/> preserve an absolutely special position in
                        Morocco. To this admission the German Ambassador replied, "Nothing could be
                        fairer, everybody is in agreement on this point." And, during the three
                        years that followed, the best efforts of French diplomacy were devoted to
                        the maintenance of peace in North West Africa. Of any sinister designs on
                        her part against the integrity of Morocco or against the commercial
                        interests of other nations in that country there is not the smallest trace.
                        Then came the Anglo-French Agreement, which was signed on the 8th of April,
                        1904. Loss than a fortnight before its promulgation M. Delcassé gave an
                        assurance to Prince Radolin that France might find it necessary to assist
                        the Sultan in the maintenance of the political and territorial status quo in
                        Morocco, bat that, whatever assistance was rendered, the commercial liberty
                        of all nations interested would be rigorously respected. This declaration
                        Prince Radolin pronounced to be quite natural and perfectly reasonable.
                        Prince von Bulow's acceptance of the Anglo-French Agreement, and his
                        admission in the Reichstag that its provisions did not affect the interests
                        if any other Power, will be well remembered. </p>
                    <p>Daring the whole of 1904, though the Pan Germanic organs began to murmur
                        about German commercial interests being in peril, there was no official sign
                        that the German Government harboured any resentment or felt any uneasiness
                        at the steps which France was preparing to take in Morocco. But as the new
                        year dawned, and as the hopelessness of the Russian entanglement in
                        Manchuria became every day more apparent, there was a sadden change in tone.
                        Germany professed to have discovered that she was being systematically
                        excluded from all participation in the negotiations over Morocco. Prince von
                        Bulow informed the German Chargé d'Affaires at Tangier "that the Imperial
                        Government totally ignored the agreements that had been concluded as regards
                        Morocco, and did not in any way recognise itself as bound in regard to that
                        question." Then came the Kaiser's journey to Tangier, and the speeches of
                        Prince von Bulow, with which we are all familiar. These, we now learn, were
                        supplemented by an amount of hectoring and persistent obstruction which are
                        scarcely paralleled in the relations of Powers that are' nominally friendly.
                        The German Chancellor left no stone untamed to represent to the French
                        Minister of Foreign Affairs that failure to comply with German demands could
                        have only one consequence. The Moroccan question, he declared, was
                        "mauvaise, très mauvaise," and he repeated that one should not linger along
                        a road which " bordered upon a precipice, and even an abyss." Words were
                        used which in international relations posse is an accepted gravity far
                        exceeding that of their usage m ordinary life. France did everything which
                        was possible to avoid any pretext for offence; her attitude carried
                        forbearauce to its extreme limit; finally M. Delcassé was sacrificed on the
                        altar of German Chauvinism, and the negotiations were concluded for the
                        Conference which is to meet to-day at Algeciras. The incident has taught the
                        world in general, and Great Britain in particular, a lesson as to Gorman
                        math ids which can never be forgotten. </p>
                    <p>The fact stands ont incontestably that for some days, if not for some weeks,
                        daring the summer of 1901 we were on the verge of a conflagration between
                        France and Germany which could not have been isolated, and must have
                        involved sooner or later the whole of Europe. A more grievous blow against
                        civilisation and humanity than the mere contemplation of such a catastrophe
                        is hardly conceivable. Even now it is not apparent how it was averted, and
                        if by any chance it should have been by the influence of England that the
                        conflict was spared, Germany, instead of feeling any resentment, ought to
                        harbour the deepest gratitude to the nation which preserved the peace and
                        saved the world from an incalculable mass of human misery. </p>
                    <p>But on the contrary we need only expect that malignant hatred that is so
                        often the lot of England because of her altruism, which foreign Powers are
                        so utterly unable to appreciate, and we should prepare ourselves to face the
                        worst. When, therefore, we reflect m the promptitude with which the disaster
                        of Russia was seized upon as an opportunity for the humiliation of her ally
                        ; whoa we consider the utter disregard of previous utterances and policy
                        which characterise the whole of the German intervention in Morocco; and when
                        we appreciate the light-heartedness with which Germany provokes a terrible
                        European débâcle, it is difficult for ns to contemplate 'he future without
                        apprehension and to look forward to the conference, who e sittings begin
                        this morning, without a certain amount of alarm. </p>

                    <p>GEORGE OGILVY HAIG.</p>
                    <p>Mr. George Ogilvy Haig, who died on Sunday week, was greatly interested in
                        Egyptian mining. He was a director of the Egyptian Gold and Gem Syndicate
                        Limited, and of the Egyptian Sudan Minerals, Limited, and was well known in
                        Cairo. He died at Chester under very sad circumstances. Mr. and Mrs. Haig
                        left 65, Brook-street on Saturday afternoon to spend Christmas with Mr.
                        Haig's sister in Dublin, breaking the journey at Chester. That night Mr.
                        Haig felt unwell, but there wore no serious symptoms until he was dressing
                        in the morning, when ptomaine poisoning declared itself in a most virulent
                        form, and in two hours he was dead. </p>
                    <p>Mr. George Haig was the fourth son of Mr. John Haig, of Cameron Bridge, Fife,
                        N B. He married nine years ago the daughter of the late Mr. William Astor,
                        of New York. His youngest brother is General Douglas Haig. The Haigs belong
                        to the well-known Haigs of Bemerside, of whom Thomas the Rhymer in the
                        thirteenth century prophesied, "Tyde what may betyde, Haig shall be Haig of
                        Bemerside." So far the prophecy bus been fulfilled, and, considering the
                        size and affluence of the family, there is no sign as yet of any failure of
                        fulfilment. </p>

                    <head>MINISTRY OF JUSTICE.</head>
                    <p>The Budget of the Ministry of Justice, which in 1905 was fixed at LE 504,200,
                        has been railed to L.E. 534.737, showing an increase of LE 80,537. Of this
                        increase, L.E. 13,103 is attributable to the Mixed Tribunals, and L.E 16,142
                        to the Native Tribunals. </p>
                    <p>There is an increase of L.E. 584 in the expenses of Central Administration. A
                        new post of interpreter bas been created in view of the increasing amount of
                        English work; some increases of salary have been granted. </p>
                    <p>Under the beading of Mixed Tribunals the increase is mainly attributable t)
                        the creation of new posts, and to the arrangement instituted in 1905, by
                        which the 2 % fee to greffiers and the travelling expenses of huissiers are
                        no longer deducted from the receipts of the tribunals. </p>
                    <p>Provision has been made for the appoint ment of an additional native Judge of
                        the Court of Appeal. </p>
                    <p>An additional foreign Judge of First Instance will also be appointed, end
                        will be attached to the Tribunal of Alexandria The Budget of 1905 provided
                        for 11 Judges of First Instance for Cairo, and 11 for Alexandria: but it has
                        been found absolutely necessary to attach 12 Judges to the Cairo Tribunal,
                        and there have thus been only 10 available for Alexandria. Experience has
                        shown that another Judge at Alexandria is needed. </p>
                    <p>The increased volume of business coming before the Tribunals of Cairo and
                        Alexandria has necessitated a corresponding increase in the number of
                        employés attached to those tribunals, and over 30 new posts have been
                        created. </p>
                    <p>The amount allowed in the Budget of 1905 for expenses formerly paid directly
                        ont of the receipts of the tribunals has been found to be insufficient, and
                        an increase of LE 3,569 is granted on this account </p>
                    <p>The pay of "hors cadre" employés has been raised. </p>
                    <p>The system of Native Assize Courts has now been in operation in Cairo and
                        Lower Egypt fir nearly a year, and appears to be a decided success The
                        system will be extended to Upper Egypt from the beginning of 1906, and
                        provision has been made for meeting the cost of his extension. An additional
                        native Judge of the Court of Appeal will be appointed, and will be available
                        for Assize work; the extension will necessitate a considerable increase in
                        the costs of transport travelling allowances and indemnities of the Judges,
                        and additional copying clerks have to be engaged. </p>
                    <p>The salaries of the Avocat-Général and of the European Inspectors of the
                        Parquet bave been raised, and an additional native Inspector of the Parquet
                        will be appointed. The work required of the medical expert attached to the
                        Parquet has become too heavy for one man, and provision is made for the
                        appointment of an assistant. </p>
                    <p>As in the case of tin Mixed Tribunals, it has been found that the sum
                        allotted for expenses formerly paid directly out of receipts is
                        insufficient: an additional sum of LE 6,500 has been provided to meet these
                        expenses. </p>

                    <p>LAST NIGHT'S MEETING.</p>
                    <p>MASS MEETING TO BE HELD.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday evening, as announced, a meeting was held at Alexandria to protest
                        against the enormous increase in the fees of medical practitioners, as
                        decreed by the recent decision of the Medical Council of Alexandria. There
                        was a fair attendance of persons and a number of speeches were made on the
                        subject of the hardships which this increase will inflict on the poorer
                        classes of the community, especially in the case of the inhabitants of the
                        city itself, where the fees have been doubled, from 5 francs to 10 francs
                        for each visit to the doctor. It was eventually decided to summon another
                        meeting for Friday next, when the following propositions will be discussed
                        and put to the vote: </p>
                    <p>That a committee shall be appointed with a view to interviewing the members
                        of the Medical Council of Alexandria and pointing out to those gentlemen the
                        injustice of their recent decision. </p>
                    <p>That a mass meeting should be organised, to be held in a local theatre, for
                        the purpose of protesting on behalf of all the inhabitants of Alexandria and
                        Ramleh against the extortions of local medical practitioners. </p>

                    <p>Drs. Bitter and Dreyer have made an interesting official statement relating
                        to the outbreak of diphtheria at Zeitoun. It appears that the first case was
                        reported on December 23, when a child died. Three more cases were noted on
                        the 28th, and Drs. Dreyer and d'Andrea visited all cases reported and
                        inoculated children who were known to have been in contact with the three
                        children actually ill, who were also inoculated with serum. In one case the
                        remedy came too late, the other two are now convalescent. On the following
                        day seven new cases were reported, six of which proved fatal. No cases were
                        reported after January 1, the total death-roll amounting to eight out of
                        twelve cases. </p>
                    <p>The anti-toxin employed was fresh Behring serum, which is universally
                        regarded as the best in existence. Rigorous measures have been taken to
                        prevent the spread of the epidemic and the schools will be closed till

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir,—"An Admirer of the British Administration" strikes the right nail on
                            the head in pointing oat that the notes of warning constancy sounded by
                            our administrators have the effect of keeping out of Egypt only the
                            British investor; I however think that he might have worded his protest
                            more strongly. No doubt in a measure the prosperity of Egypt is due to
                            the wise administration of Lord Cromer, and more so to the able
                            Irrigation engineers who have greatly improved our water supply, but
                            after all is said and done, the real factors are the wonderful fertility
                            or the soil and the untiring industry of the fellah. </p>
                        <p>The Press of England in the first instance, and latterly that of the
                            world, has so extolled our British administrators that they in their
                            turn have been brought to believe they are beings beyond or out of, the
                            common order of humanity, competent to express an infallible opinion on
                            any and every subject, hence as a result these grandmotherly efforts
                            which are periodically made to pat down what they consider gambling or
                            over-speculation, which only succeed in adversely affecting legitimate
                            business for a short time. </p>
                        <p>The European community in Egypt being small, ever one knows what
                            everybody is doing, consequently if any lucky Government official
                            possessing a small amount of capital and the sense to invest it in local
                            securities, makes a legitimate profit, the news speedily circulates and
                            our high administrators shake their wise heads and say "we mast put a
                            stop to gambling md speculation." </p>
                        <p>"Admirer is quite right when he says that there is less commercial
                            gambling in Egypt than in most countries, but he is wrong in attributing
                            this to the want of a '''term market" in stocks and shares, the reason
                            is that there are and have been daring the past few years and will
                            continue to exist for many years to come, plenty of opportunities of
                            making handsome profits by purchasing lands both agricultural and
                            building, stocks and shares, and hiding the same for a rapid and
                            legitimate rise consequently the inducement to gamble is lacking. </p>
                        <p>The only inflated value in Egypt is perhaps the estimation in which some
                            of our worthy administrators hold themselves. — I beg to remain, Sir,
                            etc., </p>

                            I very much doubt, it will be the duty of the Financial Adviser to
                            withdraw the sweeping assertions made in his Budget Note, but until that
                            is proved I think Sir Vincent Corbett has rendered a public service in

                        <p>AN ALARMIST VIEWPOINT.</p>
                        <p>To THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. </p>
                        <p>Sir,—Since the recent trouble at Alexandria I have endeavoured by various
                            methods to ascertain what feeling, if any, exists in the provinces are
                            to an anti-Christian movement. It is obvions that any attempt of this
                            sort on the part of a foreigner and a Christian is-fraught with many
                            difficulties, and that anyone looking for trouble might imagine he had
                            found it where none really existed. In common with meet people who live
                            and work in the provinces I was strongly of opinion that no danger was
                            to be looked for from the fellaheen and lashed class generally, but I
                            regret to say I have bad to alter my opinion. </p>
                        <p>I find that the "barb el deen" is the one topic of conversation among
                            them. The younger men are faying "Why should we wait for the order; let
                            us begin." The older men who look to the Sultan say, "Wait, he will give
                            the word when all is ready." They know all about the trouble in
                            Macedonia and they believe that the faith is in danger in Morocco and
                            that the time is come to make one last decisive stand against
                            ever-encroaching Christianity. </p>
                        <p>They reason thus. Against Alexandria we cannot do ouch as there are
                            English ships which we cannot do much and they are land many men, but at
                            Cairo, where there are many Christians and few soldiers, we can do much,
                            and even if the go to extremes we shall be able eventually to make them
                            give in and so compel then to leave the country, and in the provinces we
                            can do what we like. When all the Mohamedan world is fighting the last
                            great fight for the faith how shall the Christians overcome us, will not
                            God and the Prophet give us the victory? </p>
                        <p>This, Sir I affirm, is the state of affairs at the present moment, bat
                            the spark that shall start the blaze is happily lacking at the time. But
                            when the spark is kindled the conflagration will not be a small one. The
                            less that is said and the more precautions that are taken in an affair
                            of this sort the better. — Yours, etc., </p>

                    <p>NOTABLE DECREASE IN CRIME.</p>
                    <p>One result of the recent riot at Alexandria has been the extraordinary good
                        order now prevailing in the city. Petty cases in the local police courts
                        have suddenly decreased by about 80 per cent. Where there used to be 70
                        cases of "delits" and "contraventions" in the courts, now there are only 18
                        such cases and even less per diem. In the Menshieh Court, at the last
                        sitting, there was only one case. The lower classes of the population have,
                        by the wholesale arrests and the incarceration of nearly 100 of the rioters,
                        been taught a lesson, and their inclinations to rowdiness has in consequence
                        been considerably checked. </p>

                        dramatic entertainment of the first order. The programme consisted of the
                        following pieces : 1. "Democrite," fragments by J. Raynard ; 2. "En Wagon,"
                        by Verconsin ; 3. "Une Valse," monologue ; 4. Recitation of verses by Mlle
                        Moreno ; 5. Monologues by Coquelin Cadet. A ball followed the dramatic
                        entertainment and dancing lasted till a late hour, when the guests departed
                        delighted by one of thé most brilliant soirées recently given in Cairo. </p>

                        the carriage entrance the other morning at 8 o'clock, when he noticed a

                        He ran for the police commissary of the district, who sent four officials to
                        mount guard round the bomb, and shortly afterwards M. Girard, director of
                        the Municipal laboratory, sent a motor-car for the bomb and had it removed

                            <p>A renewed feeling of apprehensiveness prevails on the eve of the
                                Morocco Conference. The Spanish and Italian Press are most
                                pessimistic, and the latter is remarkable for a distinct tone of
                                hostility to Germany. Even the Berlin newspapers dispute the
                                official assurances, being uneasy owing to rumours of German
                                military preparations. (Reuter) </p>

                    <p>BANK FOR THE PHILLIPINES</p>
                    <p>The United States has determined to follow the example of Egypt in creating
                        an Agricultural Bank for the Philippine Islands. A very full account of the
                        operations of the Agricultural Bank of Egypt is contained in the report of
                        E. W. Kemmerer, chief of the currency division of the treasury, in the
                        matter of the establishment of an agricultural bank in the islands. Mr.
                        Kemmerer deals with the Egyptian plan of loaning money to agriculturists in
                        great detail and then proceeds to give an account of the draft bill
                        containing the plan proposed for the Philippines. The bill largely explains
                        itself, and requires little comment. The plan proposed is an attempt to
                        adjust the Egyptian scheme to Philippine conditions. Many features of the
                        bill, however, are adapted from provisions in the laws governing the
                        principal agricultural banks of Europe, copies of which are given in the
                        exhibits of this report. The bill contains comparatively few original
                        features, and with few exceptions the provisions of the bill in their
                        essentials have been for many years in successful operation in one or more
                        European countries. </p>

                    <p>The market this week has been doll and featureless with only minor

                        except for very short views, as we still consider the situation dangerous
                        although there has been considerable liquidation of contracts in New York
                        during this week ; we are advised by our correspondents in the South that
                        cotton is accumulating at the ports and interior towns in large quantities,
                        and unless the stringency in the money market eases very considerably, we
                        doubt the power of the factors and planters to hold the balance of their
                        crop, as they will shortly begin to require money for preparations for
                        planting. </p>
                    <p>There is another Ginners Report due on the 8th prox. which is expected to
                        show 9,800,000 ginned to the 1st January. </p>
                    <p>Theodore Price of New York, in his latest circular, maintains that this year
                        there has been more cotton he'd in the seed and on the plantations than
                        ever, and maintains his estimate that the commercial crop will be 11
                        millions or over. </p>

                    <head>JEWS AND THE JEWISH PERIL.</head>
                    <p>A remarkable and instructive article by a learned Hebrew writer, Dr. Singer,
                        the Editor-in-Chief of the "Jewish Encyclopaedia," appears in the current
                        "North American Review." Dr. Singer combats the view, held by many
                        Americans, that there is a Jewish peril, as well as a Yellow peril ; that
                        Christian civilisation, in fact, may be in danger from the multiplication of
                        the Hebrew races. It is true that there is hardly a country under the sun
                        where Jews are not to be found, bat the whole Jewish population of the world
                        does not much exceed 11,000,000. It is relatively large in tome parts of the
                        United States, and the Jews in New York City have increased to
                        three-quarters of a million, from 50,000 only a quarter of a century ago.
                        But even snob a fact as that need not alarm the most nervous, for the Jews,
                        says Dr. Singer, so fir from being, as they are popularly imagined to be, a
                        wealthy community, are "the poorest conglomeration of human beings on the
                        earth." Even in London, where the Hebrew race has free scope for commercial
                        enterprise and money-making, there is a very large proportion of poor. In
                        1883 the total Jewish population of our metropolis was 47,000 of whom over
                        11,000—that is to say about 28 per cent—were dependent on the charity of
                        their co religionists. </p>

                    <head>AN EGYPTIAN FUNERAL.</head>
                    <p>INTERESTING DESCRIPTION OF BURIAL CEREMONIES.</p>
                    <p>Egypt has been styled "the laud of the dead," and in many respects this is
                        true. No nation of the past or present so constantly brings death before us.
                        It is from the tombs, the "eternal houses" of the dead, that we learn the
                        minutest details of the living Egypt of long centuries ago. The chief life
                        rature of Nile-land is the "Book of the Dead," her pyramids are the tombs of
                        her oldest raiera, her temples, in most oases, the mortuary chapels of kings
                        or gods. In a land so devoted to eschatology, to the great hereafter, it is
                        but natural to expect that a funeral service of an interesting character
                        moat have been in use. The funeral service of the Egyptians is certainly the
                        oldest in the world; and, what is more remarkable, it varied but slightly in
                        its details from the earliest times until long after the Christian era. It
                        probably assumed its most elaborate form during the time of the Theban
                        hierarchy of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties, and this is
                        elaborately set before us in the papyri of the period. A splendid
                        enlargement of the funeral vignette of the Papyrus Ani is now exhibited on
                        the walls of the First Egyptian Room at the British Museum. Here we see the
                        funeral ritual in its most ornate form, but from the funeral stele of the
                        people we are able to trace it back to its most primitive form. </p>
                    <p>This has been most clearly worked out by M. Moret, in his study of the divine
                        character of the Pharaoh, and an extremely interesting evolution of ritual
                        is revealed. On the faneral stele the deceased is attended by a number of
                        his relatives. Among those the most important was "the eldest son," or, as
                        is more frequently called, "the son who loves." It was the duty of the
                        eldest son to minister at the interment of his father, as we read in a book
                        of instructions to the Egyptian youth. "Forget not to minister the funeral
                        offerings at the tomb of thy father and mother, that thy son may do the same
                        for thee." Next in importance to the eldest son was the "wife his beloved,"
                        often really his sister, according to the Egyptian system—for the words
                        sister and wife become synonymous. She is often represented weeping at the
                        feet of the mummy, or in earlier examples seated beside her husband. This
                        latter is the attitude adopted in some of the finest examples of Egyptian
                        art, such as the statues of Rshotep and Nefert. The wife's sister and her
                        daughter often form members of the group. Then come the other children, the
                        friends and acquaintances, and the servant, who attends on the group which
                        gathered round the grave, or assembled before the rock-cut tomb; and the
                        ceremony of whatever kind it was, was essentially a family one. </p>
                    <p>In course of time, when the priestly hierarchy replaced the family or
                        patriarchal ceremony new elements were introduced. The functions of the
                        eldest son were usurped by the sem, or ministrant priest, who performed the
                        semi-magical ritual at the grave. In the painting of the funeral of Ani he
                        is represented as walking backwards before the hier-censing it or sprinkling
                        it with holy water, a custom which has survived to the present day. On
                        either side of the sledge on which the mummy is placed, kneel two women,
                        sometimes the wife and daughter of the dead, as in the primitive ceremony,
                        but now representative of divine personages. Assisting the priest was the
                        servant, now raised to the position of server at the altar, erected before
                        the tomb, and behind them clad in a white garment astonishingly like a
                        surplice, stands the reader, or reciter, who, from a papyrus book, reads the
                        funeral service and directs the various movements of those taking part in
                        the ceremony. </p>
                    <p>Before the door of the tomb the mummy is placed, while the wife or her
                        representative kneels at the feet washing them with her tears and wiping
                        them with her hair. In the papyrus of Hunifer, an enlargement of which is
                        exhibited in the next room, we see his wife and daughter thus parting with
                        the body. The ritual is no longer that of the family function of primitive
                        times, it is all symbolical of the funeral of Osiris, with whom the
                        decreased is identified. The ministrant priest represents Horus, the eldest
                        son of Osiris-who minister at his father's grave. The reader or director is
                        the all-wise god Thoth. The friends are the four children of Horus, and the
                        wife and sister are representatives of the two faithful divine sisters, who
                        wait ever on their lord and master Osiris. In the Osirian funeral ritual of
                        the Egyptians, which remained in use certainly until the third century of
                        our era, and according to which millions were committed to the "hidden
                        land," no character are more interesting than these two divine sisters, Isis
                        and Nephthys. </p>
                    <p>These two sisters, Isis the sister wife, and Nephthys, or, to give her
                        Egyptian Nebt-Hit, "the house lady," are the ministering ones to the god-man
                        Orisis. As we learn from the festival songs of these goddesses, it is to
                        their house that he comes to rest. "Nephthys, who is called the housekeeper
                        of the gods," ministers to his wants. The two goddesses gather spices and
                        unguents, the balms of Arabia or Persia, linen and wax, with which they
                        prepare for his burial, bringing them, as we are told, "to his rock-cut
                        tomb." They weep with the weeping women over his body, wiping away the
                        impurities therefrom with their hair. So we see what a curious parallel
                        their duties present to those of Mary and Martha in the New Testament. We
                        see that many of the features of the Osirian funeral ceremony have survived
                        to this day, and it is an excellent idea of Dr. Budge to place these fine
                        enlargements in the galleries of the Museum which are devoted to the remains
                        of the dead of ancient Egypt. It may not be out of place to record here an
                        appreciation of the excellent arrangements now found in the Egyptian Section
                        of the British Museum. Twenty years ago, it was a chaos; now it is a great
                        educational exhibition. Section follows section in regular sequence, and the
                        student or teacher can really now read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest the
                        wonderful story of Nileland. </p>

                    <head>EDUCATION IN THE LEVANT. </head>
                    <p>THE SYRIAN PROTESTANT COLLEGE AT BEYROUT. </p>
                    <p>To everybody who has sojourned in the beautiful Bay of Beyrout "the College,"
                        with its magnificent background of the Lebanon range, which towers to the
                        height of 8,000ft., is familiar. For the benefit of those who have not
                        visited the busy Syrian port be it explained that "the College" is the
                        Syrian Protestant College, whose solid stone buildings give a look of
                        permanence which as a matter of fact is not belied by its history ; for it
                        is near celebrating the 40th anniversary of its birthday. Some of those who
                        know the East mast have been surprised when in 1866 its commencement, under
                        the sway of not the least notable member of the distinguished American
                        missionary family of Bliss, was recorded. Their surprise will not be
                        lessened on learning that it has never been so strong as it is at present,
                        in spite of the fact that the determination of its founders, that its lines
                        should only be Protestant in the broadest sense, has been firmly adhered to.
                        What this means will be understood when it is said that the students include
                        Greek Orthodox Churchmen, Protestants, Moslems, Jews, Druses, and Roman
                        Catholic, and when it is remembered how bitter certain sectarian differences
                        tend to become in the East—indeed, not in the East alone. And there are even
                        more nationalities than sects represented. From the Black Sea to the Sudan,
                        from Egypt and Greece to Persia there is scarcely a nationality or
                        sub-nationality but is represented at the service which is held daily in the
                        afternoon. A wonderful gathering the service is. Here are young men not only
                        of nationalities which have often been arrayed against each other, but of
                        religious beliefs irreconcilably opposed. How can the Moslem sing and pray
                        with the Christian? The answer is that he does, thanks to the broad
                        Christian spirit of the institution. The teaching and administrative staff
                        is little less remarkable in its representation of nationalities than the
                        students' roll Britons and Americans, two branches of one family, number
                        thirty-three ont of sixty-three. The remaining thirty are Syrians (no fewer
                        than twenty), Germans, Italians, Greek, Swiss, and Armenians. </p>
                    <p>If the Beyrout College were compared in one respect with the enterprise of
                        the great London philanthropist who is just dead the comparison might stand.
                        True, it would not relate to physical needs. These in the Eastern land are
                        few and easily supplied. But intellectually, morally, spiritually, a vast
                        proportion of the peoples in and about Syria would be in as bad a case as
                        the London street-boy, before the day of Dr. Barnardo, was in all these
                        respects and physically also. There are about seven hundred students on the
                        roll to-day. Since the inauguration of the college fully a thousand
                        graduates have passed from it to occupy some of the most important positions
                        in the community – such as those of physicians (civil and military),
                        lawyers, doctors, judges, teachers, preachers, editors, authors, merchants. </p>
                    <p>The chief medium of instruction is English, and to attend a service or a
                        lecture, and note the dark, earnest faces, and hear the students singing or
                        speaking the tongue of Milton and Shakespeare, is to feel in presence of an
                        Imperialism upon the ultimate consequences of which it is impossible to
                        ponder without a thrill of hope and of thankfulness. That the
                        politico-religious leaders of Moslem thought are alive to the nature of
                        these consequences needs scarcely to be insisted upon, and although hitherto
                        thanks as well to the wide-mindedness of more than one highly-placed servant
                        of the Sultan as to the tact of the authorities of the college, matters have
                        proceeded smoothly, the fate of the institution would not be long in doubt
                        but for its connection with Anglo-Saxon Powers. There are six departments,
                        and the tuition fees are £10 per term in the Departments of Commerce,
                        Pharmacy, and Medicine, £5 in the Collegiate and Preparatory Departments.
                        Board costs £12 per year – there are two terms per year, the year beginning
                        in October and ending in July – which includes cost of sleeping
                        accomodation. One hears of affecting instances of the privations which
                        students and their relatives undergo in order to provide these modest
                        amounts; nor are affecting instances of gratitude to the alma mater unknown.
                        The other day a graduate settled at Bloemfoutein established two
                        scholoarships as an acknowledgment of his own debt. </p>
                    <p>While English, as stated, is the language of instruction in all departments
                        there are thorough courses in French, German, Turkish, and, of course,
                        Arabic. The grounds are fine and spacious – nearly forty acres in all – and
                        physical exercise is given by a trained instructor. Field day – the day of
                        the annual sports – is an institution not easily to be forgotten, and when
                        the events are wound up with a game of Association football, and one hears
                        the game cries out, or, rather, yelled, in English one almost feels inclined
                        to offer a tributary yell oneself. There are over forty baths and a
                        properly, if modestly, equipped hospital. In this connection it is to be
                        added that the college is making a special effort to cope locally with that
                        scourge of the East – ophthalmia – with which object a hospital wing to cost
                        £1,000 is being taken in hand. An English traveller who visited the college
                        for the first time not long ago was so impressed with all he saw and heard
                        that he volunteered a contribution of a hundred guineas to encourage the
                        prompt establishment of the sorely-eneded ophthalmic hospital. </p>

                    <p>
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName>, <date>December 28</date>. </p>
                    <p>Christmas in over, and in London the work of the week is beginning again. But
                        here in Paris Christmas has been but the flash in the pan of the reveillon
                        feasting, the hors d'aeuvre which is the prelude for the real festival, "The
                        Day of the Year," as Parisians call the 1st of January. To one class of
                        society "In jour do Tan" has Ions terrors than it used to have, for the
                        motor car has at last made it possible for the diner out to got through his
                        round of visits within the time proscribed by the tenets of "cette bonne
                        dame Grundy." Cabs used to be not only a luxury in Paris on the 1st of
                        January—it was almost impossible to hire one. Now, thanks to the invasion of
                        the motor car, the man of fashion, who in former days was at the inert y of
                        a skeleton cocotte and her bibulous master, and who at six o'clock found
                        that his list of absolutely necessary visits was not half exhausted, will
                        manage to got through his duties with less wear and tear. </p>
                    <p>--</p>
                    <p>There is something excruciatingly funny to the smiling philosopher in the
                        demands of New Year's Day upon the Paris man of fashion, for the whole thing
                        is so gloriously artificial. He has provided himself with a load of sweets
                        prettily made up in satin bags, each bag marked with the name of a
                        well-known firm. This does not of necessity imply that the sweets have been
                        bought at the good -and expensive - establishment the name of which figures
                        in golden letters on the bag, for other firms will supply named bugs at a
                        trilling charge. </p>
                    <p>--</p>
                    <p>At every house where be has dined during the year the man of fashion must pay
                        a call. He dashes out of his car, runs in, bag in hand, murmurs a few
                        compliments over Madame's hand, kisses it, and flies. Madame, who, if be has
                        given her time, has protested that sweets from — are the only ones for which
                        she cares, puts the bag on a little table and the card on another. At
                        intervals during the afternoon her husband, who is also flying round Paris
                        on a round of sweet-delivering, drops in to replenish his supply of bonbons,
                        so that the same bag travels right round a circle of acquaintances, and very
                        often ands where it began. Still, fashion has its bye laws, and these must
                        be observed. Nobody would dream of establishing a clearing-house for New
                        Year's sweets and compliments and spending the day in tie country, although
                        I dare say a good many Parisians would like to. </p>
                    <p>--</p>
                    <p>The National Assembly, composed of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies,
                        sitting together, will meet to elect the new President of the Republic on
                        January 15, or 16, instead of the 18th, the date originally mentioned, the
                        experts in constitutional law having printed out that M. Loubet's powers
                        expire on February 18, and that his successor must be elected at least one
                        month before then. To be on the safe side, therefore, the date will be
                        altered. It is a curious fact that since the present Constitution has been
                        in force, some 30 years, no President has ever been in office at the moment
                        his successor was elected. With the exception of M. Loubet, only M. Grévy
                        completed his seven years' term, and as he was re elected, there was no
                        transmission of power. M. Carnot and M. Félix Faure died in harness. M.
                        Casimir-Perier resigned, as did also M. Grévy during his second term. So
                        that France bas never experienced the sensation of having two Presidents at
                        the same time, as she will do this year between January 16 and February 18.
                        As a matter of fact the President elected in January will only be
                        President-Designate, and will remain an ordinary citizen until at the
                        appointed time he is invested by his predecessor with the ruling power. </p>
                    <p>--</p>
                    <p>All of the three most likely candidates for the Presidency, M. Fallières, M.
                        Doumer, and M. Léon Bourgeois, are freemasons, and therefore the Clerical
                        party, in voting for M. Doumer, will be giving its support to a man, who, in
                        the eyes of the Church, is prescribed. It would be interesting to know what
                        pledges have been given to salve its conscience. </p>
                    <p>--</p>
                    <p>There are signs that Germany is contemplating a return to more gracious
                        methods in her dealings with France. If that be so, the change will be due,
                        first, to the discovery that bullying was only momentarily successful, and
                        failed after it had brought down M. Delcassé ; secondly, to consciousness
                        that the French army is quite ready to give a good account of itself ; and,
                        thirdly, to a plain intimation from Downing Street that there is no change
                        in British policy. </p>
                    <p>--</p>
                    <p>Some time ego the "Echo de Paris" sent one of its staff to Berlin to report
                        on Carman opinion on France and French foreign policy. The first results of
                        his investigations were published yesterday in the form of conversations
                        with Prince von Arenberg and Count von Reventlow, the leaders respectively
                        of the Centre party in the Reichstag and the pan- Germanic movement,
                        prefaced by the editor's remark that be does not necessarily fall in with
                        the views recorded. No wonder he felt bound to make a reservation, the
                        following being, according to Count von Reventlow, the pan Germanic dream of
                        Empire :—All the Moorish coast line and hinterland, as well as Bohemia and
                        Hungary, with a diminished Austria as a vassal State under a German Prince ;
                        Trieste, of courre, and the Adriatic littoral, Luxembourg, and Holland, and
                        Belgium. Outside Europe pan-Gemans aspire to Brazil in the western
                        hemisphere, and Mesopotamia as a foothold in Asia. When it was suggested to
                        Count von Reventlow that the <cb n="2"/>rest of be world might object to
                        this drastic alteration of the map, he said :— "We shall see. In any case we
                        do not fear France." </p>
                    <p>--</p>
                    <p>Prince von Arenberg and his party are more moderate in their demands than the
                        "whole-hoggers" of the pan-Germanic type. Germany, must have, he says, sea
                        bases and coal depots along the highways of the world. She has no intention
                        of robbing any one, but of the waste spaces still to be conquered and
                        organised she demands her share. "We have ships," he said, "on every sea,
                        the fastest and finest mail steamers afloat, and we must have Gorman ports
                        for thorn to go to. Salt water is common properly, and the Mediterranean and
                        the Atlantic cannot be closed to us." The German Emperor, Prince von
                        Arenberg said, is the most sincerely peaceful man be knows, and that only
                        his care for the vital interests of Gorman commerce made him decide to go to
                        Tangier and raise the Morocco difficulty. As the Prince twitted the French
                        Press with having "a terrible imagination," it must be assumed that he had
                        no knowledge of the conversation with Count von Reventlow. </p>
                    <p>--</p>
                    <p>France, according to the rules of sound economy, ought to be drifting towards
                        bankruptcy. She employs the deadliest of all forms of Protection—the bounty
                        system—to keep her works and mills running. But she has not been guilty of
                        the most fatal mistake of all, of letting her land go out of cultivation.
                        And that is the simple reason why France has no unemployed. Her people still
                        till the fields and grow food for the townsmen instead of Hocking into the
                        cities to take the bread out of their mouths. In an article in the
                        "République Française " yesterday morning, M. Méline says that there is only
                        one real solution to the unemployed problem in England ; the surplus
                        labourers must be got back to the land, from which they ought never to have
                        been al owed to stray. He admits that the re-conversion of town labourers
                        into farmers is no easy matter, but thinks that it-may be done gradually by
                        inculcating in them a love of the soil. He suggests that the Queen's Fund
                        and ail the resources of the State and private charity should be devoted to
                        providing working men with gardens. When once they learn what the soil will
                        do, some, at least, he thinks, will be drawn back to it, and the balance of
                        supply and demand in labour will be gradually restored. </p>
                    <p>--</p>
                    <p>From the annual report of the National Savings Banks in Franco, which has
                        just appeared for the year 1904, it is apparent that the French instinct for
                        saving is in no danger of being eradicated. The forward movement which met
                        with a temporary check in 1902-3, resumed its normal course in the year
                        under consideration. In 1903 the withdrawals exceeded the deposits by nearly
                        £610,000, but in 1904 very much the contrary was the case, the deposits
                        showing a balance over withdrawals of £1,640,000. The number of deposit
                        kooks issued numbered 4,345,446, an increase of 201,558 over the previous
                        year. At the close of 1904 the total amount of money deposited was
                        £47,393,920, the highest figure reached since the foundation of the
                        institution; and a convincing proof of the confidence of the public in the
                        soundness of the concern. </p>
                    <p>--</p>
                    <p>In Paris, the city of tasteful luxury and refined extravagance, toys are to
                        the children what more costly follies are to the elder folk. Therefore,
                        Paris is the home of elaborate toys. "Tell me what playthings you give to
                        your children, and I will tell you what you are bringing them up to be." If
                        the parents are dumb, the shop windows answer. Every year toys get more
                        elaborate, more costly, more typical of the life of wealthy Paris. The girls
                        still want dolls, but not the modest poppets their mothers played with and
                        dressed themselves. They must be as big as a good sized child, and possess
                        half a dozen toilettes packed in a trunk large enough to hold a man's
                        wardrobe. </p>
                    <p>--</p>
                    <p>The clothes must be cut after the latest model, and made of the most
                        fashionable and expensive material. Boys used to get boxes of tools, but
                        now, if they condescend to utilitarian tastes at all, they are given a
                        manufactory in miniature, with electric motors to drive the machines.
                        Generally, however, they want motor-cars or mail coaches, air ships, or
                        shooting outfits, but, most of all weapons. </p>

                    <p>ASSEMBLÉE GÉNÉRALE DES OBLIGATAIRES</p>
                    <p>(Suite et fin de la discussion.)</p>
                    <p>UN OBLIGATAIRE. — Je commence d'abord par remercier le Comité d'avoir rejeté
                        le projet des contrôleur,», contraire à nos intérêts. Et j'entre dans la
                        question des poursuites envers les administrateurs. M. Lacombe disait tont A
                        l'heare qne l'Association Nationale ne pouvait pas soutenir les actions
                        individuelles Ce pointr me semble juste. Mais l'Association a été créée pour
                        soutenir l'intérét des porteurs. Il y a ici un oas général : c'ait celui des
                        escroqueries et des vols oommis b notre détriment, qui sont justiciables de
                        la juridiction correctionnelle. L'Assooiation pourrait se joindre an groupe
                        d'actionnaires qui a déposé une plainte an parqneb Et si leparqnetet le Juge
                        d'ins traction déclarent oonpables les administrateurs, nous pourrons nous
                        porter partie civile, et l'Assooia tien pourra nous réanir pour payer notre
                        part de cotisation afin de p ycr les poursuites. </p>
                    <p>None pourrons alors faire valoir individuel lament nos droits à la réparation
                        du préjudice causé. </p>
                    <p>Je orois que la Société Générale pourrait être rendue responsable, tout au
                        moins en la personne de son Directeur. Ses employés ont donné des
                        renseignements inexacts, et le? tribunaux pourraient examiner jusqu'à quel
                        point la Sooiété Générale est responsable do ses représentants. </p>
                    <p>On nous a parlé de noos accorder 2 %. J'estime qne si nous sommes obligés do
                        faite un sacrifice, il devrait être au maximum do 100 francs par obligation,
                        payable de la manière suivante : </p>
                    <p>Les obligations actuelles seraient transformées en obligations 3 % 400
                        francs, avec première hypothèque sur tout l'actif social, à l'exception des
                        domaines achetés à la Daira Sanieh. Au cas oh la Société serait remise sur
                        pied, il nous serait donné une action de 100 francs, qui prendrait rang
                        aprè» les actions actuelles. L'amortissement serait suspendn pendant cinq
                        ans. J'estime que c'est là le maximum de concessions que nous pourrons
                        faire. </p>
                    <p>UN OBLIGATAIRE — Quelle serait la situation des Obligataires, en admettant
                        qu'il y ait faillite t Quels avantages pourrions-nous retirer d'un
                        arrangementlQue pourrions noos toucher! </p>
                    <p>M. LACOUBE — C'est là, en effa', la queition la plus importante et on
                        pourrait la qualifier de préjudiciable ; je vais y répondre. </p>
                    <p>Il y a un point sur lequel je me proposai» d'être robre de détails, parce que
                        je ne voulais pas fournir des arguments à ceux qui vans pré senteraient un
                        projet d'arrangement onéreox : c'e«t celui des coneéquenoes probables de 1a
                        faillite. </p>
                    <p>Vous pavez œ qu'est une usine à sucre. Elle peut valoir beauooup, mais
                        seulement à la condition qoel'oh pourra continuer la fabrication, car si
                        l'industrie doit cesser, il faut vendre les bâtiments à un prix inférieur,
                        et les appareils et machines se vendront également au prix du vieux
                        matériel. Si les experts ont pu les évaluer h on prix assez élevé, c'est
                        dans la prévision qu'elles continueraient à fonctionner. </p>
                    <p>Sans doute, si oes usines étaient dans la ré gion du t ord de la Frapoe, on
                        pourrait espérer trouver toojonrs un acqoéreor à un prix rai sonnable. En
                        Egypte, il n'y a pas à prévoir de oonourrence entre acquéreurs. Si vous ne
                        faites pas un concordat qui poisse assurer le relèvement de l'affaire, vous
                        verrez que l'aotif serv aobeté à vil prix par un groupe qui réalisera de»
                        bénéfices énormes au préjudice des oréan oiers actuels. </p>
                    <p>Ce qu'il importe, avant tont, ce n'est pas tant oe qn'on promettra aux
                        obligataires par le oonoordat, o'est ce qu'il adviendra de l'affaire Le
                        Comité s'est donc préoonppé principalement de ce qui pouvait assurer une
                        sérieuse réorganisation. Le projet présenté par la Société ne Ini donne pas
                        à ce point de vue de garanties suffisantes; car l'Adminis ration resterait
                        entre les mains d'actionnaires qui n'ont pas d'in'érêt à bien gérer. Voilà
                        pourquoi, dès le premier jour, nous avons appnyé, sauf à l'amender snr
                        certains points, le projet de reconstitution q i émane d'> n groupe
                        financier sérieox. </p>
                    <p>D'après ce projet, à vous Obligataires, on donnera des obligations à revenu
                        variable mais l'affaire sera réorganisée, et s'appuiera désormais, sur le
                        groupe des porteurs d'actions privilégiées, groupe qui comprendra les plus
                        grandes maisons financières de Paris. </p>
                    <p>DES VOIX. — Lesquelles 1</p>
                    <p>M. LACOMBE — Ce sont les porteurs de traite dont je parle ; vous savez qne,
                        parmi eux se trouvent plusieurs barques de premier ordre. Ces futurs
                        actionnaires se trouvent dans uno telle situation, que, l-r-qne U Société
                        aura besoin de fonds, i's n'auront pas de peili1' à trouver les conooors
                        nécessaire?. Parmi eux, je otnprenda la Sociéré Générale elle même, et il
                        est à souhaiter qne le groupe de la Daira Sugar figure parmi ces ooncours,
                        parce qo cela augmentera les chance» qne voua avez d'obtenir du Gouvernement
                        Egyptien les oon cesMnnn qne nous attendons de lui. </p>
                    <p>UN Obligataire - Le contrat de la Daira Su car est-il valable 1 </p>
                    <p>M. LACOMBE — Notre avocat du Caire nous l'a dée'aré tel. Mais, de tonte
                        façon, il taot i'iv cepter, car la reconstitution de l'affaire repose, en
                        grande partie, sur des concessions du G luvornement Egyptien, qne vous
                        obt'edrft pins f cilemrnt si l'élément anglo-égyptien est , inlériM-é à

                    <p>UN Obligataire. — De qui émane le deu- x'ème projet I Est il officieux on
                        officiel 1 A-t il des ohances d'aboutir i M. Lacoube. — Il est officieux ;
                        il émane d'un groupe financier, notamment du groupe anglo-égyptien dont il a
                        été parlé. Nos pourparlers arec la Société tendent à faire substituer œ
                        projet à l'autre comme base de discussion. Nos raisons nous paraissent
                        tellement convaincantes, que nous croyons avoir de eé rieuses chance»
                        d'aboutir à co premier résultat. </p>
                    <p>UN Obligataire. — Avant de passer au vote, voudriez vous relire le projet
                        officieux ? </p>
                    <p>M. LACOMBE — Ce projet dit qo'il sera fait une émission d'ob'igatiom
                        hypothécaires de 800.000 livres ; les obligations actuelles seront réduites
                        de 20 % et deviendront variables. Les porteurs de traites, recevant dos
                        notions privilégiées, ne viendraient pas en concurrence avec Iss
                        Obligataires. Pendant les trois premières années, il serait servi à ces
                        derniers un intérêt fixe garanti de dix franos. Il est vrai qn'on ne nous a
                        offert jusqu'ici que 7 fr. 50. </p>
                    <p>UN Obligataire — Les Obligataires au raient-ils le droit de préférence dans
                        la souscription des nouvelles obligations bypothé caires ? </p>
                    <p>M. LACOMBE. — S'il est réclamé, il sera sans doute volontiers aooordé. Au
                        sujet de la réduction du capital nominal des obligations, tonten maintenant
                        leur intérêt et leur amortissement au taux aotuel, ce n'est qu'uue question
                        de omptab lité tendant à équilibrer le bilan La durée de l'amortissement est
                        fixée à 50 ans. </p>
                    <p>Nous faisons tous nos efforts poor ramener la Société à ce projet, autant
                        pour éviter anx Obligataires, la concurrence des porteurs de traites, q
                        .'afin de pouvoir compter sur eux pour assurer à l'affaire une bonne
                        direction. </p>
                    <p>UN Obligataire. — Aurons-nous une qnote part de fonds provenant de la vente
                        Cronier t M. Lacombe — Noua n'avons pu étndié spécialement cette question.
                        On ne pourrait enc .re former saisie-arrêt sur cette somme ; il faudrait
                        d'abord obteuir ud j ugement constatant le droit de oréanoe. C'est nue
                        question dont le Comité pourra se préoccuper. </p>
                    <p>Un OBLIGATAIRE' — Le Comité ne pourrait- il pu inviter les représentants de
                        1a Sooiété en Egypte à faire cette saisie ? </p>
                    <p>M. LACOMBE. — Le Comité soumettra cetta question à ses Conseils du Caire. </p>
                    <p>Un OBLIGATAIRE. — Je me demande s'il n'y aurait pas intérêt à envisager la
                        possibilité d'nDe liquidation ? </p>
                    <p>Notre Comité devrait faire étudier la question de savoir si l'on ne pourrait
                        pu obtenir des Tribunaux égyptiens de nous faire passer avant les porteurs
                        de traites ? Dans le cas contraire, nous aurions intérêt à dire : si les
                        porteurs de traites ne veulent pu faire un sacrifice beaucoup plus grand que
                        celui qu'on nous demande, tant pis pour eux, et l'on procédera à la
                        liquidation. </p>
                    <p>M. LACOMBE. — Nous avons posé cette question de droit commercial égyptien à
                        M. Saint- Plancat, qui nous a répondu qu'il n'y avait pu légalement de
                        difiérenoes entre les porteurs de traites et les Obligataires, sous réserve
                        de l'examen de choque oréanoe devant le Tribunal. Mais, en dehors du droit
                        striot, il y a les pourparlers amiables, grâce auxquels nous espérons
                        pouvoir faire passer les porteurs de traites après tes Obligataires. </p>
                    <p>Un Obligataire. — Pour que nous puissions exercer faction sociale ou les
                        actions individuelles dont on a parlé tont à l'hsure, et pour pouvoir nous
                        grouper dans ce but, il importe que nous nous connaissions. Je deman de donc
                        qu'nne liste des adhérants nous soit communiquée par l'Assoeiation, </p>
                    <p>M. LACOMBE. - ,'edois dire que l'Association a déclaré expr esté ment, lors
                        de sa fondation, que pour tous les renreiguements qui lui seraient donnés
                        par les porteurs sur les valeurs qa'ils possèdent, elle se considérait oomme
                        tenue par le secret professionnel. </p>
                    <p>M. LE PRESIDENT. — La discussion étant terminée, et vu l'impossibilité de
                        prendre une décision défiuitive en oe moment sur les propositions
                        concordataires, je vous invite à voter simplemeut les trois résolutions

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty

                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of

                        Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte
                        Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhorn.</p>
