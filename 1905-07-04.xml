                    <p>The heavy majority—over one hundred — by which the French Chamber has
                        dissolved the connection between Church and State, has been no surprise. For
                        years past the electors of France—that is, the entire male population —have
                        displayed a vague dislike of the Roman Catholic Church certain to lead in
                        the end to Disestablishment and Disendowment. They have never shown sympathy
                        with the Clericals, have never resisted any proposal because it was disliked
                        by the Church, and have even tolerated mere insults, such as abolishing the
                        exemption from the conscription formerly enjoyed by students for the
                        priesthood. The cause of this change—for there has been a great change since
                        the peasantry welcomed Napoleon’s restoration of public religious rices—is
                        partly, no doubt, a gradual decay of faith, leading in certain quarters to a
                        malignant hostility to Christianity, and partly owing </p>

                    <p>to the unwise attitude of the Church herself. The Vatican has professed to be
                        careless about forms of government, but has been steadily anti-Liberal, has
                        allied itself with all reactionary movements and persons, and in the last
                        thirty-five years, during which a new generation of voters has grown up, has
                        looked with dislike and suspicion upon the Republic itself. The majority of
                        the French people, therefore, though always disinclined to new expenses, and
                        quite aware, if only through their wives’ remonstrances, that they will have
                        in future to pay for offices which they do not intend to forego, welcome
                        what they think a great blow to a hostile power, and gladly allow represents
                        atives whom next year they will be able to dismiss, and who therefore are
                        voting in obedience to constituents, to accept the second clause of the
                        Separation Bill, which runs as follows “The Republic neither recognises,
                        pays salaries to, nor subsidises any form of worship.’’ That clause, which
                        was voted by 336 to 236, strips the priesthood of France of what has
                        hitherto been their only maintenance, for though urinate and churlish
                        pensions will be granted for one generation, those who enjoy them will pass
                        rapidly from the scene, and will find their allowances insufficient, if not
                        supplemented by gifts, even to keep houses over their heads. The priesthood
                        of France are, in fact, thrown back for their maintenance upon a people of
                        whom a large section are distinctly unbelieving, and a majority most
                        reluctant to pay even for the offices which, as we have said, they are
                        nevertheless not prepared to do without. </p>
                    <p>The blow to the Church is most severe, and we are by no means satisfied that
                        it will not be found to be also a blow to civilisation. We hold that, apart
                        altogether from the transcendent question of what is ultimately true,
                        Christianity is incomparably the best creed, because it alone restricts the
                        exercise of power, insists upon the obligation of all to each as well as of
                        each to all, and sets up a definite ideal which no philosophy has yet
                        succeeded in surpassing. A civilised State in announcing that it is
                        agnostic, or at all events indifferent, does not, as moat Ultramontanes
                        appear to think, condemn Christianity ; but it does announce that in its
                        belief Christian faith and Christian conduct are not indispensable to a
                        civilised society, does cease to announce that it is the best of creeds, and
                        does refuse to imply that its teaching is the groundwork of the laws. That
                        change is probably injurious, even in countries like Great Britain and
                        America, where the opinion about Christianity is strong enough to take the
                        place of laws; and in a sceptical or half-sceptical country like France its
                        total effect may be much worse. There are no voluntary bodies willing and
                        able to take the place of the State Establishment. France will not be left
                        without a priesthood; but large and poor districts may, their population
                        thus growing up without Christian teaching and therefore without restraints
                        save those of visible utility and the Code, neither of which can do the
                        restraining work completely. France had experience of that condition during
                        her Revolution, and the comment of the wisest observers is that in all men
                        who were lads during that period something essential to the best citizenship
                        seemed to be wanting. Moreover, the Church will herself be deteriorated,
                        first, by the additional influence of the peasantry upon the priesthood,
                        which we have not found to work well in Ireland, especially as regards
                        property questions; and secondly, by the deeper tone of Ultramontanism which
                        a Roman Catholic priesthood released from the restrictive action of State,
                        and thrown upon the Vatican for guidance and for the maintenance of its
                        cohesion, is certain to develop. That extreme Ultramontanism tends not only
                        to breed war between the religious classes and the State-in itself a
                        frightful evil—but to beget infidelity in the masses by pressing assertions
                        opposed to reason much too sharply. Frenchmen will not believe without
                        thinking, as Neapolitans do ; they have advanced beyond that, and are
                        unhappily very apt, when convinced that the chapel of Loretto did not fly
                        through the air, to give up with belief in invented miracles the essentials
                        of Christianity. </p>

                            <p>Immediately Admiral Kruger’s fleet returned a council of admirals and
                                captains was held on board the flagship “Rostislav.” It was resolved
                                to ungear the machinery, as the officers and men desired to land.
                                The reservists have been granted two months’ leave. </p>
                            <p>The ironclad “Ekaterina II.,’’ which had remained here, has been
                                disarmed. The sailors who have landed report that when the squadron,
                                of which the “Pobyedonosets” formed a part, arrived at Odessa, the
                                “Potemkin” definitely refused to obey the signal to rejoin them.
                                Thereupon the “Pobyedonosets” mutinied and the squadron returned to
                                Sevastopol. </p>
                            <p>It is said that the “Pobyedonosets” surrendered on conditions, after
                                the crew had been informed what their punishment would be. The ship
                                is in the inner port, under heavy guns mounted on the boulevards
                                overlooking the harbour. (Reuter.) </p>

                            <p>The Roumanian Government has ordered the “Potemkin” to leave the port
                                or to surrender. In the latter case the mutineers will be treated as
                                foreign deserters. The mutineers are considering the demand. </p>
                            <p>The leader of the mutineers has informed the port captain that the
                                killing of the sailor on board the “Potemkin” was merely a pretext
                                for the mutiny, which had been previously arranged by a

                        <p>—Yesterday, at 9 a.m., Awad Said Bekhit, of the village of Awlad Sheikh,
                            Ghirgeh province, was executed at the prison of the Court of Appeal.
                            Said Bekhit murdered three of his fellow-villagers in January, 1904.
                            Ahmed Sharbin El-Kaffassa, of Samanoud, was executed at Tantah at 7

                        <head>Continental Hotel.</head>
                        <p>—The management of the Continental Hotel are taking advantage of the
                            summer months to carry out a number of improvements which will greatly
                            add to the comfort of the visitors who will patronise this popular hotel
                            daring the coming and future seasons. The new lift which is being fitted
                            is rapidly nearing completion and is already in position. It is much
                            more spacious than the one used in former seasons, and has the further
                            advantage of being worked by electricity, whereas the one at present in
                            use is worked by hydraulic pressure. The saloon which is attached to the
                            bar and billiard-room is being considerably enlarged, and though this
                            will entail the main saloon being made somewhat smaller, the latter will
                            still be quite large enough. Stangen’s offices, which form part of the
                            Continental buildings, are being enlarged considerably, the steps which
                            at present lead to the bar entrance are being brought nearer the main
                            entrance, and the space thus left free will be added to these offices.

                        <p>The following telegram has been received at <name type="place"
                                >Alexandria</name> to-day from Mr. Theodore Price of <name
                                type="place">New York</name> :—</p>
                        <p>Arithmetically to-day’s Government report indicates an American cotton
                            crop for 1905-6 of 10,273,500. This assumes a plant as far advanced as
                            last year’s at this time, and the same remarkably favorable weather
                            hereafter that existed in 1904. The first condition does not exist and
                            cannot be developed; the second is altogether unlikely, reasonably
                            considered, and the trade is therefore called upon to adjust itself to
                            the expectation of a crop of under 10,000,000 bales for the coming
                            season. I hesitate to say what price this means for cotton, but I am
                            confident that it will sell somewhere between twelve and fourteen cents
                            in the near future. People laughed and assailed my sincerity when I
                            predicted this advance, just as they did last year, when on the 3rd of
                            June, 1904, I predicted a crop of 12,000,000 or over. They may so treat
                            this statement, and it is always dangerous to say, “I told you so,” but
                            a lifetime of study devoted to cotton convinces me that we are face to
                            face with revolutionary conditions in the cotton trade. We have marketed
                            the last 14,000,000 bales at practically an average of nine cents a
                            pound. What does this mean for less than 10,000,000 bales ? An
                            imagination restrained by commercial precedent hesitates to answer, but
                            it must be very high. Russo Japanese peace and the Americanisation of
                            the Orient, combined with gold inflation and a famine supply, will
                            produce results as extraordinary as they are regrettable. The one bright
                            spot in the situation is that the South will become by virtue of its
                            cotton monopoly enormously rich. These are radical opinions but in times
                            of revolution only radicals are right.</p>

                        <head>A PROVIDENTIAL ARBAGI.</head>
                        <p>Last Saturday, four Greek burglars broke into the shop of Ismail el
                            Gellad and his son, in the Sharia Cherkess, Abdeen quarter, Cairo. After
                            forcing the door the thieves made an unsuccessful attempt to break open
                            the iron strong-box and then took it into the street, covering it with a
                            blanket They then hailed an arabieh and drove with the box to a house
                            where one of the party lived. </p>
                        <p>On Sunday morning the police heard from the shopkeeper the news of the
                            disappearance of the strong box. A crowd collected at the scene of the
                            robbery, and the arbagi while driving past realised that he had
                            unwittingly aided a burglary the night before, and promptly told his
                            story to the mamour of the kism.</p>
                        <p>The police, the arbagi, and the victims of the robbery drove to the house
                            where the box with its contents of over L.E. 800 in gold and shares had
                            been taken. </p>
                        <p>On the way the arbagi, keeping up the part of “deus ex machina” which he
                            had assumed, recognised one of his last night’s fares, who was thereupon
                            seized by the policemen. The burglar promptly denounced all his
                            associates to the Hellenic consular authorities. The strong-box was
                            recovered, and the remainder of the gang and a woman were arrested. It
                            seems to us that the public owes to the arbagi this marvellous example
                            of injured virtue taming the tables on vice. </p>

                                York</name>, that it is expected the number of American visitors to
                            Egypt next winter will be greater than that of any previous season,
                            beating last winter's record. Even at this early date thousands of
                            tourists from all parts of the United States have made arrangements for
                            the journey to Europe and Egypt for next winter. Clark’s famous cruises,
                            inaugurated four or five years ago, have already been organised for the
                            coming winter, and the well-known ocean leviathan “Arabio” has been
                            chartered by Mr. Frank C. Clark for the annual cruise to the
                            Mediterranean and Egypt. </p>
                        <p>In connection with the Nile trip part of the excursions, the luxurious
                            steamer “Victoria,’ of the Anglo-American Line, has been engaged for the
                            next season to run between Cairo and Luxor and Assouan in coincidence
                            with the ocean cruises. </p>
                        <p>The above should prove good news to the hotel proprietors and others in

                        <p>The annual report of this institution shows that for the year to 31st
                            December last the net profits, after making allowance for bad and
                            doubtful debts, amount to £397,460, which, with the sum of £24,034
                            brought forward, makes an available balance of £421,494, against
                            £394,175 a year ago. For the reserve fund and the percentages in
                            accordance with the statutes £50,517 is required, as compared with
                            £45,141, leaving £370,977 for distribution. The committee recommends a
                            dividend of 14s. per share, equal to 7 per cent, on the paid-up capital,
                            and there remains £20,976 to be carried forward. The dividend compares
                            with 6 1/2 per cent for the previous year, and is larger than any
                            declared since 1894, when 8 per cent was paid. The proportion of profits
                            distributed to the founders’ shares is the same as for the previous

                            kaleidoscopic colourings, is gradually being transformed out of all
                            recognition, and several of its old landmarks have already disappeared.
                            The ancient range of buildings with their old-fashioned mousharabieh
                            windows, a few yards from the entrance to the street at the main tramway
                            station, have been pulled down and on the extensive site belonging, we

                            engineer. At other old ramshackle row of bouses, nearly opposite this
                            site, have also been recently demolished, and in their stead some fine
                            new buildings with handsome modem shops have been erected for the Daira

                        <p>Our Fayoum Correspondent writes: I recently had occasion to attend the
                            examination of the pupils of the American Girls’ School here and was
                            very kindly received by Miss Martin, a Pennsylvanian lady who is head
                            mistress of the school. The pupils answered the questions asked them in
                            arithmetic, history, geography, Scripture knowlege, etc., very smartly
                            and I greatly admired their cleanliness and neatness. Miss Martin
                            deserves great credit for the success with which she has taught her

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir, — One of the growing minor scandals of Cairo is the increasing
                            number of European bootblacks who do the work which, ten years ago, was
                            confined, and properly so, to small Arab boys. To see these great,
                            hulking, unkempt men sitting on their boxes is a disagreeable sight.
                            They are besides a source of frequent disturbance, being resented by the
                            people generally, I believe, and certainly by the original Arab guild.
                            At all events let no more licenses be granted to European men, and let
                            those already licensed be confined to one or two spots. In Cape Town
                            they are confined to one spot only, and there the nature of the climate
                            demands much more bootcleaning than does Cairo. </p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. </p>
                        <p>Sir, — I would trespass upon the valuable space of your paper to the
                            extent of a few lines to call the attention of the Railway
                            Administration to the disgraceful state of the lavatories of the trains
                            on the Pont Limoun to Marg line. I travelled from Zeitoun on the 11 p.m.
                            train last night and on entering the lavatory compartment I was
                            disgusted to find it in a most filthy condition. To all appearances it
                            had not been cleaned for weeks, whilst there was no water in the
                            cisterns, and the odour emanating from it was most unhealthy.
                            Unfortunately this complaint can frequently be made of express trains of
                            the main lines, and when travelling by them I have always found it
                            advisable to make use of the lavatory of the restaurant car when there
                            has been one attached to the trains, and as they are almost invariably
                            clean and healthy I think the Railway Administration could not do better
                            than take a lesson from the company which runs these cars. </p>
                        <p>—I remain, etc.,</p>

                        <p>D’un autre côté, en 1897, la durée des études secondaires a été abaissée
                            de 5 à 3 années. Cette réduction qui, soit dit en passant, n’avait été
                            décidée par le Ministère que sous la pression des administrations
                            recrutant leur personnel technique parmi les élèves des écoles
                            supérieures, avait pour but, en augmentant le nombre de jeunes gens
                            obtenant annuellement le Certificat d’Études Secondaires, d’assurer àces
                            écoles supérieures, alors fort peu peuplées, un recrutement suffisant.
                            Mais si elle a permis d’atteindre, en partie du moins, le but que l'on
                            se proposait, elle a eu malheureusement pour conséquence forcée un
                            certain abaissement du niveau des études secondaires, abaissement qui,
                            il est vrai, s’est trouvé atténué par les progrès réalisés dans
                            l’enseignement primaire, mais qui n’en est pas moins incontestable,
                            notamment en ce qui concerne la connaissance des langues étrangères
                            étudiées dans ces écoles.</p>
                        <p>Cet affaissement du niveau des études secondaires a eu nécessairement sa
                            répercussion sur l’enseignement supérieur. L’insuffisance des étudiants
                            dans la connaissance de la langue étrangère présente, en effet, pour les
                            écoles supérieures, un inconvénient d’autant plus grave que cette langue
                            sert de médium pour l'enseignement des cours techniques, de sorte que
                            ces écoles loin de pouvoir, comme elles le désiraient, faire disparaître
                            de leurs plans d’études renseignement des langues étrangères, ont dû au
                            contraire le renforcer et lui accorder plus de temps.</p>
                        <p>C’est l’École Khédiviale de Droit qui a le plus souffert de la réduction
                            de la durée des études secondaires ; car, non seulement elle a dû
                            continuer renseignement de la langue européenne qui est usitée pour
                            l’enseignement du droit, mais, en outre, pour des raisons spéciales,
                            elle a été amenée à introduire dans son plan d’études, dès 1899,
                            l'enseignement d’une deuxième langue étrangère (le français pour les
                            étudiants ayant appris l’anglais dans les écoles secondaires et
                            l’anglais pour les étudiants ayant appris le français).</p>
                        <p>Ces enseignements parasites sont naturellement mal vus du personnel
                            enseignant des écoles supérieures ; ils ont, en effet, le grave
                            inconvénient de distraire l'esprit des élèves des cours essentiels et
                            d’absorber un temps précieux qui devrait être entièrement consacré aux
                            études spéciales qui sont la raison d’être de ces écoles ; il n’est donc
                            pas douteux qu’il serait avantageux de les faire disparaître du plan
                            d’études des écoles supérieures.</p>
                        <p>Toutes ces considérations ont amené le Ministère à étudier un plan
                            nouveau d’organisation de l’enseignement secondaire, propre à réaliser
                            le double but qu’il se propose d’atteindre :</p>
                        <p>(a)Se mettre en mesure de fournir, pour les besoins du recrutement des
                            employés des administrations de l’État, un nombre suffisant de candidats
                            ayant fait des études d’un niveau plus élevé que le degré primaire,
                            c’est-à-dire ayant suivi pendant un temps convenable, des cours
                            d’enseignement secondaire ; et, comme conséquence, obtenir que le
                            Certificat d’Études Primaires ne donne plus accès aux emplois de
                            l’État</p>
                        <p>(b)Porter les études littéraires et scientifiques dans les écoles
                            secondaires à un niveau tel, que les élèves pourvus du Certificat d’Étu-
                            des Secondaires puissent recevoir avec fruit l’enseignement des écoles
                            supérieures, sans qu’il soit nécessaire de maintenir dans aucune de
                            celles-ci des cours préparatoires qui ne sont qu’une continuation des
                            études secondaires.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="bold">Propositions concernant un nouveau plan d’organisation
                                de l'enseignement secondaire</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Après un examen approfondi de cette importante question, le Comité
                            Technique est d'avis que les moyens les plus propres d’obtenir ces
                            résultats sont :</p>
                        <p>1° De porter de trois à quatre années la durée des études nécessaires
                            pour l'obtention du Certificat d’Études Secondaires, exigé pour
                            l’admission dans les écoles supérieures ;</p>
                        <p>2° De créer un examen spécial pour les élèves qui auront complété le
                            cours d’études des deux premières années secondaires, en vue de délivrer
                            un certificat, dit ''Certificat d’Aptitude aux emplois inférieurs du
                            cadre du personnel civil” donnant le droit, soit de continuer les études
                            secondaires, soit de postuler pour des emplois dans les administrations
                            de l’État.</p>
                        <p>En conséquence, le Comité Technique propose de modifier le plan d'études,
                            les examens et les programmes de l’enseignement secondaire, conformément
                            aux projets exposés ci- dessous.</p>
                        <p>(a)Plan d’études des deux premières années secondaires ( Voir annexe A)
                            et Certificat d’Aptitude aux emplois inférieurs du cadre du personnel
                            civil. ”</p>
                        <p>D’après la nouvelle organisation, toutes les matières qui sont inscrites
                            actuellement au plan d’études des écoles secondaires, continueront à
                            être enseignées pendant les deux premières années du nouveau cours, mais
                            avec un programme allégé ; c’est sur le programme de ces deux premières
                            années que portera l’examen du Certificat d’Aptitude aux inférieurs du
                            cadre du personnel civil ; il y sera même ajouté une épreuve de dessin
                            en raison de l’utilité incontestable de cette matière pour laquelle,
                            d’ailleurs, les jeunes Égyptiens possèdent de remarquables dispositions. </p>
                        <p>Le Ministère pense que les candidats qui auront subi avec succès cet
                            examen d’aptitude, seront incomparablement supérieurs à ceux qui n’ont
                            fait que des études primaires. Tout d’abord, leurs connaissances
                            générales seront considérablement étendues ; ensuite, et ceci est plus
                            important, pendant ce séjour de deux années dans les écoles secondaires,
                            ils se trouveront dans un niveau plus élevé que celui des écoles
                            primaires, et ce changement ne peut<cb n="2"/>être que très profitable à
                            la formation de leur esprit et à leur éducation générale. On peut donc
                            espérer que les employés ainsi préparés seront aptes à remplir leurs
                            emplois à la satis faction de leurs chefs.</p>
                        <p>D’après les prévisions du Ministère, il est probable que plus de 800
                            candidats, dont 500 au moins des écoles du Gouvernement, se pré
                            8enteront à cet examen dès l’année 1907, et que ce nombre ira en
                            augmentant très rapidement d’année en année. Si l’on préjuge des
                            résultats de cet examen d’après l’expérience acquise dans les examens
                            antérieurs, on peut admettre que 40 % des candidats, soit 320 au moins,
                            sont appelés à réussir en 1907, de sorte que, dès cette même année, on
                            pourrait disposer, pour remplir les emplois des administrations de
                            l’État, de plus de 150 jeunes gens pourvus du Certificat d’Aptitude,
                            nombre qui serait plus que doublé dès l’année 1909.</p>
                        <p>Il n’est donc pas téméraire de présumer qu’à partir de janvier 1910, il
                            n’y aura plus aucune nécessité d’accepter dans les emplois des ad
                            ministrations du Gouvernement des candidats munis seulement du
                            Certificat d’Études Primaires, et le Ministère n’éprouve aucune
                            hésitation à proposer qu’à partir de cette date, ce Certificat cesse
                            d’être un titre d’admission aux emplois de l’État.</p>
                        <p>(b) “Règlement de l’examen du Certificat d’Aptitude aux emplois
                            inférieurs du cadre du personnel civil (Voir Annexe B). ”</p>
                        <p>L’examen pour l’obtention du Certificat d’Aptittude aura lieu pour la
                            première fois en 1907, conformément aux prescriptions du Règlement
                            ci-joint (Annexe B).</p>
                        <p>En ce qui concerne la marche générale de l’examen, ce Règlement ne
                            diffère pas sensiblement de celui qui a été jusqu’ici en vigueur pour
                            l’examen du Certificat d’Études Secondaires. Toutefois il est prévu que
                            les candidats qui auront subi avec succès les épreuves, seront aptes à
                            occuper des emplois du cadre rétribués à raison de LE 6 comme traitement
                            de début. Cette clause d’une très grande importance, paraîtra
                            certainement justifiée. Il n’est pas possible en effet d’assimiler, an

                            pour le juillet, mais, par suite de réalisations, les cours vers clôture
                            ont recalé à 14 5/32, ce qui fait quand même de la hausse sur
                            l’ouverture. Le fait est pour le moins curieux avec une filière comme

                            <p>We publish to-day the composition and the terms of reference of the
                                Royal Commissionappointed by the King to investigate the question of
                                military stores in South Africa. 'The names of the Commissioners
                                will command the respect and confidence of all serious men of
                                whatever party, though it would be too much to hope that they, or
                                any other persons who might have been chosen, will satisfy rabid
                                partisanship. By the promptitude with which the Commission has been
                                appointed Mr. Balfour has justified his declaration that he would be
                                no party to dilatory tactics. By the comprehensive terms of its
                                reference he has also shown his determination to have the whole
                                matter sifted to the bottom. The Commission is appointed “ to
                                investigate the allegations made in the " report of the committee
                                presided over by " Lieutenant-General Sir W. F. Butler, K.C.B., “
                                dated May 22nd last, to report upon all the " circumstances
                                connected with contracts, sales “ and refunds to contractors in
                                South Africa “ after the conclusion of peace, and upon any “
                                previous transactions which may throw light “ on them ; and further
                                to report upon the “ responsibility of the persons concerned, “
                                whether in this country or in South Africa. It would be difficult to
                                enlarge the scope of this reference. It will be the business of the
                                Royal Commission to make a serious and impartial investigation. In
                                the meantime let us all try to suspend our judgment.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>After the closure had effectually suppressed Mr. Churchill’s
                                characteristic effort to reopen the debate to day, the latest vote
                                of censure was defeated in a full House by a majority of
                                seventy-four. Nothing could better demonstrate the futility of the
                                Opposition tactics yesterday than the tone and substance of the
                                speech in which Sir Robert Reid moved his resolution. It was
                                moderate and unimpassioned, as was to be expected from one who had
                                been Attorney- General, and who may reasonably expect still higher
                                rank in his profession. But he must have felt the glaring
                                inconsistency of his position. He carefully refrained, as Mr.
                                Balfour fully admitted, from attacking the individuals indicted in
                                the Butler Report, but he assailed the Government on the ground of
                                the alleged offences of their agents. He assumed that all the
                                allegations contained in this report were true and well founded,
                                while he supported the appointment of a Royal Commission instructed
                                to discover whether these allegations are true.</p>
                            <p>The vote last night settled nothing, for it could settle nothing. But
                                the challenging of that vote, and the manner in which it was
                                challenged by nearly every Opposition speaker except Sir Robert
                                Reid, but including Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman, will disturb the
                                minds and paralyse the hands of that distinguished and devoted body
                                of men who, under every clime, are serving their King and country,
                                either as soldiers or as members of our splendid and unrivalled
                                Civil Service.”</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>We are by no means taking it as proved that the War Office has been
                                cleared of all but venial errors and such mistakes as may naturally
                                occur when a vast series of intricate transactions has to be
                                conducted at a great distance from the central authority and by
                                agents many of whom are fresh to the work and not specially adapted
                                for it. When the whole facts have been judicially examined, we may
                                discover that individuals are to blame as well as the system. But it
                                is also conceivable, as Mr. Brodrick generously hoped, that some of
                                the officers who have been so severely censured may have a better
                                reply than was originally anticipated. It would be an inexpressible
                                relief to public feeling if it should turn out that they can claim
                                an honorable acquittal.</p>

                            <p>To-day the nation will have to decide whether it will or will not
                                allow society to whitewash the authors of the South African
                                scandals. During the last twenty-four hours the situation has
                                developed in unpleasant and sinister directions. It is clear that we
                                are in for the biggest fight for national honesty that this
                                generation has known. In the Ministerial Press and in Parliament a
                                concerted counter attack is being levelled at Sir William Butler.
                                The one man who told the truth before the war, and who was recalled
                                for telling the truth, has had the audacity to repeat his
                                unpardonable offence. Gratitude to a faithful servant ? Not a bit of
                                it. “The Daily Telegraph —Mr. Balfour’s official organ—in the course
                                of an article of almost incoherent frenzy, denounces the suggested
                                inclusion of Sir William Butler amongst the Commissioners, on the
                                ground that “the draughtsman of the notorious Report is as much upon
                                his trial as any of those censored or assailed with poisonous
                                innuendoes.</p>

                            <p>day has gone past when the workmen will march the rifles behind a
                                portrait of the Tsar with a legend of loyalty in their hearts. Their
                                leaders have adopted a plan <cb n="2"/>which must make enormous
                                demands on the faith and self-sacrifice of the masses behind them.
                                There can be no regular campaign, as there was in the thirties, when
                                a Polish army actually invaded Russia, nor even an organised
                                guerilla warfare in the forests, as there was in the sixties. The
                                telegraph, the railway, the repeating rifle, and universal military
                                service have altered the condition of the struggle. But, on the
                                other hand, there is now a vast industrial population ready to
                                enlist in the Socialist ranks which would never have followed a
                                Nationalist standard carried by Polish aristocrats.</p>

                            <p>The Peking correspondent of the “Times” tells us that China is
                                following with deep interest the Washington Peace Conference : She
                                thinks that, inasmuch as the terms of peace must affect her
                                interests as a Sovereign Power, she ought also to be represented.
                                Friendly Ministers here advise her, however, that the logical
                                outcome of her representation would be an international Conference,
                                which must be avoided at all hazards. They remind her that
                                international interference after the last war led directly to the
                                present war, and that all the other nations, except Japan, declined
                                to interfere while Russia was engaged in absorbing Manchuria.
                                Opinion in Peking grows stronger that a peace conference now is
                                premature, that the spirit in which Russia is entering the
                                conference gives no indication of sincerity, but that manifestly she
                                is endeavouring to gain time by means of an armistice. The opinion
                                is universal that an armistice would give an immense advantage to
                                Russia. The Russians at Peking have now recovered their spirits, and
                                confidently look to General Linievitch to recover Russian prestige.
                                It is impossible not to admire this spirit of <hi rend="italic">nil
                                    despeperandum,</hi> but at the same time Russia would be much
                                better off if she had a greater capacity for appreciating the
                                facts.</p>

                            <p>Yesterday evening, during the reception at the British Embassy it was
                                reported that the situation had improved. It was denied that Sir
                                Francis Bertie had advised M. Rouvier to offer a desperate
                                resistance to the German proposals. In French official circles the
                                opinion is unanimous that the attitude of Great Britain is
                                excellent, and far from inciting us against Germany our neighbour
                                encourages us in our pacific attitude.</p>
                            <p>“Petit Parisien.”</p>
                            <p>The Berlin correspondent of the “Petit Parisien,” according to the
                                Central News, declares that the Kaiser, while engaged in
                                conversation with a representative of one of the great Powers
                                recently on the subject of the possibility of war, said : “At the
                                cost of considerable sacrifices, which the German nation bears
                                patriotically, we are in possession of a powerful army ready for
                                action ; nevertheless, the mission we assign to it is essentially
                                defensive, for, in conformity with the pacific genius of the German
                                race, Germany will never on her own initiative develop an aggressive
                                policy in Europe unless compelled to do so by reason of <hi
                                    rend="italic">force majeure</hi>, and it seems that the present
                                advanced state of civilisation of the surrounding nations must
                                render such an eventuality most improbable.”</p>

                            <p>France has all our friendship and all our respect. Shall we then
                                stand by and see her exposed to the least danger ? Appealing to the
                                good sense of the French people, friends of peace, we encourage
                                France to go to the International Conference, where she will be
                                surrounded by every kind of prestige. The Conference will, by a
                                counterstroke, arrest the Teutonic ambition which at present has the
                                best opportunity of exercising excessive influence on the Saltan.
                                Before the impending danger we mast make a supreme effort, and
                                advance with rapid strides towards a European <hi rend="italic"

                                with her present possessions in Africa, and must resolve never to
                                spend a single man or a single peseta in Morocco.</p>

                            <head>THE DOOR OF MOROCCO.</head>
                            <p>Tangier and its environs represent about as much of his Shareefian
                                Majesty’s realm of Sunset Land as the average tourist sees.
                                “Christian-ridden Tanjah,” as Moors call it— “the city afflicted of
                                Allah with dogs and infidels,” is not at all a typical Moorish town,
                                bat it has its interests at any time, hugely enhanced at the moment
                                by the Kaiser’s recent visit ; and, despite its European
                                Legations,and their dinner-parties, it is still strangely remote
                                from Europe, in most senses, considering its nearness in one sense.
                                How many countries are there, with a sea-board, a littoral, of their
                                own, which up to now have been in no way exploited by Christendom,
                                which owe no suzerainty to any civilised nation ; in which none of
                                the powers of Western modernity have been able to mark out a sphere
                                of influence ? There are very few of them left—very, very few. The
                                buccaneer business is prettty nearly played out. There are not many
                                sea skirted gardens left for the Westerns to absorb.</p>
                            <p>The more reason, then, that we should learn all there is to be
                                learned about the few. Persia is one of them. Morocco is another ;
                                and when you have named those two, you shall seek far and far for
                                the next. And Morocco was not only ripe in our hand, once, but its
                                chief port, Tangier,was positively occupied and garrisoned by us.
                                But the little Englanders of that period said, “Why should we be
                                paying this eighteenpence a week to be occupying a far-off savage
                                place, when for a shilling a week we might supply new doormats to
                                the offices of the Sealing Wax Department ?” So our soldiers were
                                withdrawn, and we walked out of Tangier</p>
                            <p>Legend hath it that the interesting daughters of Hesperus, with their
                                golden apples and their insomnious dragon, had the mountain behind
                                Tangier for their garden. It may be so, and certainly the nymphs
                                possessed a very charming property if it were so. If frequenters of
                                the fashionable northern shores of the Mediterranean did but know
                                it, there is no sea-view in Europe so magnificent and so gladsomely
                                spacious as is the outlook from Tangier’s mountain. It may be
                                doubted, too, whether in any part of Europe one may breathe an air
                                at once so gently calm and so joyously stimulating as that which
                                stirs the heather and sways the perfume of wild flowers on this
                                Moorish hill</p>
                            <p>But—and here one touches the essence of the matter—let some
                                enterprising speculator approach the Moorish authorities for a slice
                                of this garden of the Hesperides and permission to erect villas or
                                an hotel there, and he will find himself in a fair way to obtain
                                preliminary understanding of the true inwardness of Moorish affairs.
                                He will also he taking a good swinging step towards bankruptcy.</p>
                            <p>“Tangier, the city, is sufficiently afflicted of Allah with infidels,
                                Heaven knows,” sighs your Tangier Moor, whose living comes to him by
                                way of the same unbelievers ; “but the country, the hills and
                                valleys of this our Al-Moghreb, without the walls of
                                Christian-cursed Tanjah ; these, by Allah and his Prophet, we will
                                preserve from the Nazarene, his sacrilegious presence, his polluting
                                touch, his beastly jugglery with drain-pipes and devil-sent, wire-
                                carried light, his shameless naked-faced women in their open,
                                glass-windowed houses !”</p>
                            <p>To the Hesperides’ Garden, the Land of the Lotus Eaters, an exact
                                present-day panorama of the age of Moses, a return ticket for twenty
                                pounds ! Consider it ! A month of Deuteronomy ; thirty days of
                                patriarchal Canaan ; the simple, primeval smack of the world’s
                                herdtending youth in your nostrils for less than a pound a day !</p>
                            <p>Yet here in Tangier are electric light, telephones, and at least two
                                hotels superior in point of comfort, cuisine, and general
                                accommodation to anything in British Gibraltar or in Southern Spain.
                                The hotels one accepts, as a Britisher would accept an hotel in
                                Timbuctoo, as a matter of course. The electric lamps, in yard-wide,
                                roofed, and intricate Tangier streets, in blind, murderous-looking
                                cul-de-sacs, and about the crumbling city walls—these remain a
                                standing marvel to the most careless observer in this home of
                                incongruities.</p>
                            <p>On the top of the Kasbah hill men are bastinadoed, loaded with
                                chains, racked and thumb- screwed, maimed, blinded, burned, and
                                starved, not for crime, but because they are suspected of having
                                saved money, and yet have dared to deny the same when a thieving
                                Basha sought to rob them of their savings.</p>
                            <p>A few yards down the hill-side there is a telephone, in the house of
                                a man who believes devoutly in the evil eye, would rather die than
                                taste potted ham, and would blithely sell his aged mother into
                                torture and starvation for a hundred dollars. He has sold others for
                                less. Still, he would rather die than eat pork. And there is a
                                telephone under the roof which shelters him. A portly and respected
                                person is Ben Sayeff, the half bred Moorish Jew, of the house below
                                the Kasbah.</p>
                            <p>From sunrise until sunset Tangier is a kaleidoscope, an ever-shifting
                                panorama of pictures from out old family bibles, a cinematographic
                                reproduction of one’s childish conceptions of the Orient.</p>
                            <p>By nine or ten o’clock in the evening all is still, and most things,
                                save the furtively nosing pariahs and the greatly daring sôk rats,
                                are sleeping. Occasionally some wakeful melancholy wight strums idly
                                at a two-stringed gimbri, or an aggressively pious man sits up to
                                drone out his belief in Allah, His oneness. But for the most part,
                                Tangier, lapped on one side by its silvern bay, and hung over
                                caressingly from within by its mountain of the Hesperides’ Garden,
                                Tangier slumbers peacefully (save when the mueddin in a mosque tower
                                demands response to his prayerful declaration of faith) until the
                                coming of that dim, cool, mauve light, calm and spacious, which
                                tells of dawn, imminent and ever beautiful. </p>

                                <p>A simple, guileless, innocent life for a city you say. And—well,

                                    in which he makes holiday. For its surface, Tangier has a
                                    delightful climate, it is more Orientally picturesque, more
                                    essentially and beautifully of the time- careless and fatalistic
                                    East, than anything west of Arabia. It is safe, and has
                                    comfortable quarters to offer ; yet it is absolutely
                                    unmodernised, and untouched in its essence by civilisation. He

                            <p>John Hay, journalist, author, and diplomatist, whose death was
                                announced yesterday, was bom at Salem, Indiana, Oct. 8, 1838, and
                                graduated at Brown University, 1858. He was admitted to the Bar in
                                Springfield, Illinois, in 1861, but almost immediately went to
                                Washington as Assistant Secretary to President Lincoln, and
                                subsequently was his Adjutant and Aide-de-Camp. During the Civil War
                                he served for a time under Generals Hunter and Gillmore, attaining
                                the rank of Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General. From 1865 to
                                1867 he was Secretary of Legation in Paris, and from that time to
                                1868 was Chargé d’Affaires at Vienna. He was appointed Secretary of
                                Legation in Madrid in 1869, where he remained until 1870, when he
                                returned to the United States, and became one of the editors of the
                                “New York Tribune.” This position he resigned in 1876, upon his
                                removal to Cleveland, Ohio ; but he continued occasionally to
                                contribute to its columns. During the absence of the editor, Mr.
                                Whitelaw Reid, in Europe, from April to November, 1881, Colonel Hay
                                returned to New York to take entire editorial charge of the
                                “Tribune.” From 1879 to 1881 he was Assistant-Secretary of State.
                                While on the “'Tribune” he obtained considerable celebrity by his
                                dialect poems of “Jim Bludsoe,” ''Little Breeches,” &amp;c.; which
                                were afterwards published in book form under the title of "Pike
                                County Ballads,” 1871. In the same year he also issued “Castilian
                                Days,” a series of sketches of Spanish life and character. He
                                represented the United States at the International Sanitary Congress
                                held in Washington in 1881, and was chosen President of that body.
                                He was subsequently engaged (in collaboration with John G. Nicolay)
                                in writing a Life of Abraham Lincoln, which was published as a
                                serial in the “Century," from 1886 to 1890, and was printed in 1890,
                                with extensive additions, in 10 vols. 8vo., by the “Century” Co. He
                                was American Ambassador to England in 1897-8 and relinquished this
                                post to take up that of Secretary of State, a position he occupied
                                till the time of his death.</p>

                            <p>The report for 1904 of the Upper Congo Railway Company to the African
                                Lakes states that 91,020 kilogrammes of indiarubber were received
                                during the year, together with 1,980 kilogrammes of ivory. Including
                                the guarantee of the Congo Free State, the accounts show net profits
                                amounting to frs. 718.708, which sum allows of the payment of 4 per
                                cent interest on the paid-op capital. On April 29th the earth works
                                of the railway were completed to kilometre 85, and the rails had
                                been laid to kilometre 56. The two stem-wheel steamers ordered by
                                the Congo State for the transport of materials for the construction
                                of the company’s railways have been delivered, and are now in
                                service, with good results. In addition to iron and steel bridge
                                work the company has sent out to Africa 6,000 tons of rails, seven
                                locomotives and 66 wagons, together with repairing shop machinery
                                and breakdown plant.</p>

                                <head>TURKISH POSTAL REFORM. </head>
                                <p>Western Europe has no great interest in Turkish schemes of postal
                                    reform, except when, as has happened at least once, the Porte
                                    attempts to “reform” the foreign post offices out of existence.
                                    The Ottoman authorities now announce that they are about to
                                    place the whole of the internal Turkish postal system on a basis
                                    of thorough efficiency, and a commission has been appointed,of
                                    which the president and two, at least, of the principal members,
                                    are men whose competence and character inspire confidence. It is
                                    doubtful, however, whether the Ambassadors of the Powers will
                                    ever consent to foreign correspondence being placed at the mercy
                                    of Turkish officialdom.</p>

                                <p>In spite of the reduction of freights which occurred daring 1904,
                                    and greatly accentuated by the dispute between the German and
                                    London lines, this company appears to have done a little better
                                    than in 1903, a dividend of 6 per cent, on the Ordinary shares
                                    being now declared as against 5 1/2 per cent twelve months ago,
                                    leaving £1,765 to be carried forward. The debenture debt of the
                                    “City Line,” which at the date of the last report amounted to
                                    £214,690, has now been reduced to £207,490. Daring the year four
                                    new steamers have been received from the builders, and five more
                                    are under construction. The reserve fund remains unchanged at
                                    £35,000, but the company still holds Mr. J. R. Eller- man’s
                                    special deposit of £250,000. The fleet is valued in the balance
                                    sheet at nearly £2,000,000. </p>
