                            <p>Immediately Admiral Kruger’s fleet returned a council of admirals and
                                captains was held on board the flagship “Rostislav.” It was resolved
                                to ungear the machinery, as the officers and men desired to land.
                                The reservists have been granted two months’ leave. </p>
                            <p>The ironclad “Ekaterina II.,’’ which had remained here, has been
                                disarmed. The sailors who have landed report that when the squadron,
                                of which the “Pobyedonosets” formed a part, arrived at Odessa, the
                                “Potemkin” definitely refused to obey the signal to rejoin them.
                                Thereupon the “Pobyedonosets” mutinied and the squadron returned to
                                Sevastopol. </p>
                            <p>It is said that the “Pobyedonosets” surrendered on conditions, after
                                the crew had been informed what their punishment would be. The ship
                                is in the inner port, under heavy guns mounted on the boulevards
                                overlooking the harbour. (Reuter.) </p>

                            <p>The Roumanian Government has ordered the “Potemkin” to leave the port
                                or to surrender. In the latter case the mutineers will be treated as
                                foreign deserters. The mutineers are considering the demand. </p>
                            <p>The leader of the mutineers has informed the port captain that the
                                killing of the sailor on board the “Potemkin” was merely a pretext
                                for the mutiny, which had been previously arranged by a
                                revolutionary committee. (R.) </p>

                        <p>—The management of the Continental Hotel are taking advantage of the
                            summer months to carry out a number of improvements which will greatly
                            add to the comfort of the visitors who will patronise this popular hotel
                            daring the coming and future seasons. The new lift which is being fitted
                            is rapidly nearing completion and is already in position. It is much
                            more spacious than the one used in former seasons, and has the further
                            advantage of being worked by electricity, whereas the one at present in
                            use is worked by hydraulic pressure. The saloon which is attached to the
                            bar and billiard-room is being considerably enlarged, and though this
                            will entail the main saloon being made somewhat smaller, the latter will
                            still be quite large enough. Stangen’s offices, which form part of the
                            Continental buildings, are being enlarged considerably, the steps which
                            at present lead to the bar entrance are being brought nearer the main
                            entrance, and the space thus left free will be added to these offices.

                        <p>The following telegram has been received at <name type="place"
                                >Alexandria</name> to-day from Mr. Theodore Price of <name
                                type="place">New York</name> :—</p>
                        <p>Arithmetically to-day’s Government report indicates an American cotton
                            crop for 1905-6 of 10,273,500. This assumes a plant as far advanced as
                            last year’s at this time, and the same remarkably favorable weather
                            hereafter that existed in 1904. The first condition does not exist and
                            cannot be developed; the second is altogether unlikely, reasonably
                            considered, and the trade is therefore called upon to adjust itself to
                            the expectation of a crop of under 10,000,000 bales for the coming
                            season. I hesitate to say what price this means for cotton, but I am
                            confident that it will sell somewhere between twelve and fourteen cents
                            in the near future. People laughed and assailed my sincerity when I
                            predicted this advance, just as they did last year, when on the 3rd of
                            June, 1904, I predicted a crop of 12,000,000 or over. They may so treat
                            this statement, and it is always dangerous to say, “I told you so,” but
                            a lifetime of study devoted to cotton convinces me that we are face to
                            face with revolutionary conditions in the cotton trade. We have marketed
                            the last 14,000,000 bales at practically an average of nine cents a
                            pound. What does this mean for less than 10,000,000 bales ? An
                            imagination restrained by commercial precedent hesitates to answer, but
                            it must be very high. Russo Japanese peace and the Americanisation of
                            the Orient, combined with gold inflation and a famine supply, will
                            produce results as extraordinary as they are regrettable. The one bright
                            spot in the situation is that the South will become by virtue of its
                            cotton monopoly enormously rich. These are radical opinions but in times
                            of revolution only radicals are right.</p>

                        <head>A PROVIDENTIAL ARBAGI.</head>
                        <p>Last Saturday, four Greek burglars broke into the shop of Ismail el
                            Gellad and his son, in the Sharia Cherkess, Abdeen quarter, Cairo. After
                            forcing the door the thieves made an unsuccessful attempt to break open
                            the iron strong-box and then took it into the street, covering it with a
                            blanket They then hailed an arabieh and drove with the box to a house
                            where one of the party lived. </p>
                        <p>On Sunday morning the police heard from the shopkeeper the news of the
                            disappearance of the strong box. A crowd collected at the scene of the
                            robbery, and the arbagi while driving past realised that he had
                            unwittingly aided a burglary the night before, and promptly told his
                            story to the mamour of the kism.</p>
                        <p>The police, the arbagi, and the victims of the robbery drove to the house
                            where the box with its contents of over L.E. 800 in gold and shares had
                            been taken. </p>
                        <p>On the way the arbagi, keeping up the part of “deus ex machina” which he
                            had assumed, recognised one of his last night’s fares, who was thereupon
                            seized by the policemen. The burglar promptly denounced all his
                            associates to the Hellenic consular authorities. The strong-box was
                            recovered, and the remainder of the gang and a woman were arrested. It
                            seems to us that the public owes to the arbagi this marvellous example
                            of injured virtue taming the tables on vice. </p>

                            Egypt next winter will be greater than that of any previous season,
                            beating last winter's record. Even at this early date thousands of
                            tourists from all parts of the United States have made arrangements for
                            the journey to Europe and Egypt for next winter. Clark’s famous cruises,
                            inaugurated four or five years ago, have already been organised for the
                            coming winter, and the well-known ocean leviathan “Arabio” has been
                            chartered by Mr. Frank C. Clark for the annual cruise to the
                            Mediterranean and Egypt. </p>
                        <p>In connection with the Nile trip part of the excursions, the luxurious
                            steamer “Victoria,’ of the Anglo-American Line, has been engaged for the
                            next season to run between Cairo and Luxor and Assouan in coincidence
                            with the ocean cruises. </p>
                        <p>The above should prove good news to the hotel proprietors and others in
                            the Metropolis who benefit so largely from the ever-increasing tourist

                        <p>The annual report of this institution shows that for the year to 31st
                            December last the net profits, after making allowance for bad and
                            doubtful debts, amount to £397,460, which, with the sum of £24,034
                            brought forward, makes an available balance of £421,494, against
                            £394,175 a year ago. For the reserve fund and the percentages in
                            accordance with the statutes £50,517 is required, as compared with
                            £45,141, leaving £370,977 for distribution. The committee recommends a
                            dividend of 14s. per share, equal to 7 per cent, on the paid-up capital,
                            and there remains £20,976 to be carried forward. The dividend compares
                            with 6 1/2 per cent for the previous year, and is larger than any
                            declared since 1894, when 8 per cent was paid. The proportion of profits
                            distributed to the founders’ shares is the same as for the previous

                            regulations of the Veterinary School, Cairo. A fourth year’s course is
                            now added, in which surgery, medicine, parasitology, meat inspection,
                            and the study of contagious diseases with clinical work will be taught
                            to the pupils. The new regulations will be brought into force to date
                            from January 1, 1905, but will only be applicable to pupils entering the
                            school on and after October 1 of the present year. </p>

                            kaleidoscopic colourings, is gradually being transformed out of all
                            recognition, and several of its old landmarks have already disappeared.
                            The ancient range of buildings with their old-fashioned mousharabieh
                            windows, a few yards from the entrance to the street at the main tramway
                            station, have been pulled down and on the extensive site belonging, we
                            are told, to the Wakfs Administration, a large block of modern buildings
                            is gradually raising its head at a cost of something like £16,000, the

                            engineer. At other old ramshackle row of bouses, nearly opposite this
                            site, have also been recently demolished, and in their stead some fine
                            new buildings with handsome modem shops have been erected for the Daira

                            Wakfs intend replacing them by large blocks of modem dwellings and

                            examination of the pupils of the American Girls’ School here and was
                            very kindly received by Miss Martin, a Pennsylvanian lady who is head
                            mistress of the school. The pupils answered the questions asked them in
                            arithmetic, history, geography, Scripture knowlege, etc., very smartly
                            and I greatly admired their cleanliness and neatness. Miss Martin

                        <p>Sir, — One of the growing minor scandals of Cairo is the increasing
                            number of European bootblacks who do the work which, ten years ago, was
                            confined, and properly so, to small Arab boys. To see these great,
                            hulking, unkempt men sitting on their boxes is a disagreeable sight.
                            They are besides a source of frequent disturbance, being resented by the
                            people generally, I believe, and certainly by the original Arab guild.
                            At all events let no more licenses be granted to European men, and let
                            those already licensed be confined to one or two spots. In Cape Town
                            they are confined to one spot only, and there the nature of the climate
                            demands much more bootcleaning than does Cairo. </p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. </p>
                        <p>Sir, — I would trespass upon the valuable space of your paper to the
                            extent of a few lines to call the attention of the Railway
                            Administration to the disgraceful state of the lavatories of the trains
                            on the Pont Limoun to Marg line. I travelled from Zeitoun on the 11 p.m.
                            train last night and on entering the lavatory compartment I was
                            disgusted to find it in a most filthy condition. To all appearances it
                            had not been cleaned for weeks, whilst there was no water in the
                            cisterns, and the odour emanating from it was most unhealthy.
                            Unfortunately this complaint can frequently be made of express trains of
                            the main lines, and when travelling by them I have always found it
                            advisable to make use of the lavatory of the restaurant car when there
                            has been one attached to the trains, and as they are almost invariably
                            clean and healthy I think the Railway Administration could not do better
                            than take a lesson from the company which runs these cars. </p>
