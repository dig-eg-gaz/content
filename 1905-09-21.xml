                    <head>THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1905. Dr. BARNARDO.</head>
                    <p>This morning's telegraphic news tells us of the passing away of one of
                        England’s, or rather Ireland’s, most remarkable sons. Thomas John Bamardo,
                        F.R.C.S., Edinburgh, whose philanthropic efforts on behalf of the waifs and
                        strays, not only of London, but of many of the large cities of the United
                        Kingdom, are known the wide world over, was born in 1845, and completed his
                        60th year only a month or taro since. Whilst a student at the London Hos
                        pital in 1866, where he was studying, preparatory to mission work in China,
                        his attention became directed to the terribly neglected state of the
                        homeless boys in the East End of London. So pitiable were their tales, that
                        it was some time before be could realise that he was not being deceived, but
                        the more he enquired into the truth of their stories, the more did he find
                        that the actualities were even worse than the boys’ statements. Under their
                        guidance he explored a wilderness of old sheds, tumble-down outhouses and
                        wreckage near Houndsditch and Petticoat-lane by night Here in one place he
                        saw before him eleven poor boys from 9 to 18 yean of age, sleeping in all
                        postures, clad in their rags, and exposed under the open sky to wind and
                        rain. Those who know what this means in London, will readily believe the
                        doctor when he says that the eight followed him and haunted him, causing him
                        to reflect on the hideous actualities and the seamy side of modem
                        civilisation, and rousing him to action. Possessed of indomitable energy,
                        full of a sympathy that has never weakened, and fired with an enthusiasm
                        that has never failed, spite of great physical weakness at times, Dr.
                        Barnardo gave up his contemplated missionary life abroad, and devoted
                        himself to home mission work among the waifs and stray of London, and no
                        more convincing evidence of the wonderful gifts he possessed of
                        organisation, persuasion, and intuition could possibly be given, than a bare
                        recital of the list of the various institutions established by him, all
                        endowed with a vitality that astonishes the visitor; and even at the present
                        time increasing in number. The bare statement in the Annual Report for 1903,
                        that 12,305 applications were received, and admission granted in 4,078
                        cases, gives no idea of the true meaning of the figures or of their diverse
                        character, and it is only an intimate acquaintance with the working of the
                        various homes and agencies, that at all enables one to form an idea of the
                        magnitude of the work, and the enormous responsibility that rested upon the
                        shoulders of their now deceased founder and director. </p>
                    <p>Dr. Barnardo was, undoubtedly, the chosen instrument for carrying out a work
                        of incal-culable benefit to the world at large. The impression largely
                        prevails that his work was confined to the helping of waif and destitute
                        children only. These came first undoubtedly, but of the many poor children
                        that owe their chances in life to him, many have been well and tenderly
                        brought-up, have known more of a parent’s love than the children of wealthy
                        parents in fashionable life whose one object is to live a life of pleasure,
                        but, from adverse circumstances of all kinds, have become destitute. The
                        Stepney headquarters bear in letters of gold, the following motto, “No
                        destitute child ever refused admission,” and whatever might be the cause of
                        the destitution the help was given, and in very many oases was not confined
                        to the children themselves. The ramifications of this vast enterprise were
                        enormous, and so well and thoroughly has the work been done by the various
                        heads of departments that there is little or no fear of any disorganisation
                        occurring through the lamented decease of the head of the institutions. Dr.
                        Barnardo was not the man to leave things to chance. For some yean he has
                        been warned of the inevitable result of continued work at high pressure, and
                        tour years ago he was plainly told that he must give up work or die. But
                        rest to a man of his temperament was simply impossible. He has gone to
                        Nauheim every summer for treatment of the heart disease from which he
                        suffered, only to return to work, lecture, preach, visit branch
                        establishments, and in his spare time consider the huge mass of
                        correspondence placed before him by his secretaries, work that frequently,
                        even of late, occupied him till the small hours of the morning. The end has
                        come at last, and it will not be at all surprising to those who knew Dr.
                        Barnardo, to learn that it came suddenly, and that he died in fall harness.
                        We regret that within the limits of this article it is impossible to give
                        more than the hasty and imperfect sketch we have written respecting this
                        truly remarkable man. Hie work has been monumental, and hie memory will be
                        enshrined in the hearts of hundreds of thousands—indeed we may say
                        millions—of those whom in one way or another he has benefited. To those who
                        have come into personal relations with him, and knew the man himself, the
                        loss seems irreparable, and we feel it will be long ere we shall look upon
                        hie like again. </p>

                            and the eventual reference to arbitration of certain other questions,
                            are virtually agreed upon, other knotty points are still unsettled, but
                            it is believed that they will be adjusted satisfactorily. Meanwhile
                            troops are kept in the neighbourhood of the frontiers. (Reuter) </p>

                        <p>We have pleasure in calling the attention of our readers to the splendid
                            preparation of Messrs. Allen and Hanburys, Ltd., the celebrat-ed London
                            chemists, which is being offered for sale under the title of
                            "Allenburys’ Diet.” It would seem to be specially suitable for our
                            climate, where the best of milk is not always obtainable. We are
                            informed that Messrs. Allenburys’ Diet is a complete food in itself for
                            invalids, convalescents, and the aged. It is very palatable, easily
                            prepared, and when. taken before bed-time will be found to induce sleep.
                            Allenburys’ Diet can be carried to advantage by tourists travelling at
                            home or abroad. It is made in a minute, and is very easy of
                            assimilation. [Advt.] </p>

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES. FEATURES OF CONCORDAT.</head>
                    <p>A reprieve saves a prisoner from being hanged, it does not necessarily carry
                        with it an order of his instant release from gaol. Such is the character of
                        the concordat préventif ; it staves off a sudden and reverberating financial
                        crash, but it may only delay a compulsory liquidation. In the case of the
                        Sucreries, we hope for the sake of the country that the respite will enable
                        the company to reorganise and recover, but while we recognise this pleasant
                        possibility, we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that nothing in the
                        decision of the, Cairo Mixed Court can be taken as a guarantee that the
                        compulsory winding-up of the company will not eventually become necessary.
                        Article 206 (new) of the Mixed Code gives the terms on which a person or
                        corporation is allowed to enjoy the benefit of the concordat préventif. Its
                        chief features are these. The appointment by the tribunal of one of its
                        members, the “juge commissaire” who takes and goes through the debtor’s
                        books and finds his exact financial situation, decides under what conditions
                        if any, the debtor can continue to do business, calls a meeting of the
                        creditors, reads them a report on the situation, on the question of the
                        debtor’s good faith and his proposals. </p>
                    <p>Once the juge commissaire is appointed the debtor ceases payments by right. </p>
                    <p>The names of the administrators under the concordat suggested by Maitre
                        Carton de Wiart have been formally accepted by the Court. M. Debourg, we
                        understand, will sign for his colleagues, Sir Elwin Palmer and Harari Pasha,
                        during their absence. </p>

                        first-class hotel, whilst the representative of another syndicate just
                        arrived in Cairo has been making enquiries for acquiring property in the
                        Opera Square, also with the intention of erecting a large up-to-date hotel
                        with a splendid arcade of shops underneath. We shall publish fuller details

                    <head>A DRAMA OF THE DESERT.</head>
                    <p>In our issue of the 13st instant we mentioned that advice bad been received
                        from Assiout by the Ministry of the Interior that two camel-men, accompanied
                        by a policeman, who had left there the previous week, having in their charge
                        some money for the pay of the police at the Oasis, bad been murdered, and
                        that the policeman who returned to Assiout with the news was wounded in the
                        bead. As the money was found intact it was at once seen that the motive for
                        the crime could not have been robbery. An enquiry was at once instituted by
                        the local Parquet and the mamour of the district, while a force of police
                        was sent in search of the murderers who, the wounded policeman averred, were
                        brigands. As no tracks could be found near the spot where the murders had
                        been committed suspicion was aroused,and the policeman was suspected of
                        having been guilty of the deed himself. It now appears that the latter was
                        accompanied by his wife, and three traders also went with the caravan. </p>
                    <p>From the evidence of the latter it now transpires that it was the policeman
                        himself who shot the camelman, (not two as originally reported), in
                        consequence of having discovered an intrigue between him and the woman. On
                        hearing the report of a gun one of the traders rushed out of his tent to
                        discover the cause, and was himself also shot dead. The medical man who
                        examined the wounded policeman was of opinion that the wounds he bore in the
                        head were self inflicted, and such turns out to be the case. This man, who
                        is now in hospital, has been placed under arrest, and will be tried for the
                        murders as soon as he is sufficiently recovered. </p>

                        the permission, and she arrived here safely late on Monday night. </p>

                        <p>To THE Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. </p>
                        <p>Sir,—With reference, to your article of the 21st ult., your leader writer
                            appears to have so misunderstood some of the suggestions made by Mr.
                            Roussin as to the rules to be followed in calculating the tature
                            currency needs of Egypt, that I should like to be allowed to criticise
                            the critique. </p>
                        <p>The regulation of a token currency is a. comparatively simple matter, and
                            does not give rise to the divergent theories that exist, for instance,
                            in the case of paper currency. This is because a token currency
                            regulates itself, the rôle of the Government being confined in ordinary
                            circumstances to the replenishment of its stock when it is getting low,
                            as is done, for instance, in England. </p>
                        <p>Something more than this is necessary in Egypt, because if the government
                            waited till its holding began to get low, the new supplies could not be
                            minted in time to meet the the demand. This makes itself felt at one
                            season of the year only, i.e. during the cotton season in October, and
                            November, while the silver takes three months to arrive from date of
                            order. The instructions, to the Mint must therefore be given not later
                            than July, supposing that it is necessary to make fresh provision. </p>
                        <p>In July and August the Government hold ing reaches its maximum (i e. the.
                            circulation reaches its minimum) so instead of ordering new supplies,
                            when stock is running, low, the somewhat paradoxical rule of ordering
                            that just at the moment when there is most in band has to be adopted. </p>
                        <p>The data available for determining the amount to be ordered are as
                            follows : </p>
                        <p>1. The demand for extra coin for the cotton crop includes and greatly
                            exceeds the amount required to inorease the permanent circulation. The
                            public takes what it wants for the cotton crop, retains what it
                            necessary for increase in circulation owing to growth of population,
                            etc., and returns the rest, when the marketing of the crop is
                            practically over, into the hands of the Government. Thus last winter the
                            public took out LE 360.000 in silver, of which the Government received
                            book L.E. 200.000 daring the spring and summer of this year, the balance
                            of LE 160.000 being retained as the permanent addition to the
                            circulation. Hence it is obvious that there is not the slightest
                            necessity to consider any of the points detailed by your leader-writer.
                            The Government by providing for the cotton crop and for that alone,
                            provides ipso facto much more than enough for all other contingencies. </p>
                        <p>2. The figures for past seasons show that the demand for the crop varies
                            roughly according to its price, its quantity and the rapid-ity with
                            which it is brought to market, But at the time it is necessary to order
                            coin, none of, these factors can be foretold with any pretention to
                            accuracy, and “keeping in touch with banks and markets” is of very
                            little help. Therefore the only safe course is to presuppose a crop of
                            maximum quantity at a very high price, and provide for that always. </p>
                        <p>3. To do this it becomes imperative to fix the minimum, corresponding
                            with the above-mentioned contingency, below which the Government reserve
                            at the opening of the cotton season most not be allowed to descend. The
                            experience of past years shows that even in season of record crop and
                            prices, the expansion. in the winter circulation has never-reached
                            £400,000. That amount has there fore been chosen as the irreducible
                            minimum the Government must have in band. This rule is not a fixed one,
                            since it does not prevent the Government from providing any amount over
                            the minimum which it may deem advisable. </p>
                        <p>Had this policy been initiated earlier, there would have been no
                            impediment to the automatic self regulation of the currency, and no
                            scarcity would have occured.—I am, Sir, etc. Fiscal. </p>

                    <p>(From our Financial CORRESPONDENT.</p>
                    <p>London. September 15th </p>
                    <p>During the latter part of the week the Stock Exchange has been occupied with
                        the fort-nightly settlement, which has been an unusually heavy one, owing to
                        the large increase in business which is now taking, place. The directors of
                        the Bank of England decided on Thursday last to make no change in the Bank
                        rate. Pending their decision, prices were heavy, but as soon as it was known
                        that they had made no alteration, buoyancy all round was the order of the
                        day. The Bank returns show that notwithstanding the large withdrawals of
                        gold, the reserve had only fallen ₤189,000 owing to the reflux of coin and
                        notes from circulation here; and this now stands at. £24,506,000. There is
                        still a feeing that the demand for gold for Egypt and South America must
                        increase, and consequently it is thought probable that a higher rate will
                        prevail in the autumn ; even a 4% rate should not be detrimental, as the
                        signs of improvement in trade throughout the country are becoming more
                        evident every day. Consols, which were as low as 895/8 rose to 8913/16 , and
                        close to day at the latter price. In the foreign market, Japanese bonds were
                        firmer on a good demand, the First Four-and-a-half percent rising 1/4 to
                        947/8 and the Second 1/8 to 33/4 premium. They leave off at 943/4 and 33/4
                        premium respectively Russians remain unchanged, with the exception of a
                        nominal rise of 11/3 in the Fives, Home Rails show little change on since
                        last week, with the exception that Southern stocks have advanced slightly.
                        The American market has been active with a reaction in prices which is
                        considered only natural after the recent advances. Reports from the United
                        States are most optimistic both as regards the condition of the crops and
                        the trade outlook. Consequently higher prices are looked for all round
                        during the winter months. </p>
                    <p>In the Egyptian section there has been some good buying of the shares of the
                        Anglo-Egyptian Bank. The company, it is stated, has had an exceedingly
                        profitable year, National Banks are firm at 273/4 and Agricultural Banks
                        maintain their prices at 14 5/8. A new franco-Egyptian Bank has been formed
                        under English law, with a capital of £500,000 in £5 shares. The whole this
                        amount has been placed and the £5 are now quoted on the Paris Bourse at
                        61/4. This bank is con-nected with the Credit Mobilier in Paris and the
                        Credito Mobiliare in Italy. which was current in the early park of the week
                        that Sir Ernest Cassel, was interested in the promotion with the idea of
                        assisting the reconstruction of the Societe des Sucreries et Raffinerie
                        d’Egypte is quite incorrect. </p>
                    <p>Now that most of the parties interested in the above concern are in Cairo you
                        will proba-bly be obtaining earlier information as to the course of events
                        in connection with the ********** of this company ; the understanding here,
                        however, is that it will be granted the benefit of the concordat preventif.
                        The shares of the Daira Sugar Company are quoted today at 43/4. </p>
                    <p>In the mining section the continued interest in Rhodesian shares has had a
                        good effect on the market generally, and if this continues we shall see
                        higher prices in almost all sections Nile Valle, to which we called
                        attention when they stood, at 15/— have been as high 13/8 with good-buying,
                        due to a belief in the satisfactory settlement of the Robinson interest and
                        also to the report from the manager that a good crushing of 405 tons yielded
                        365 ounces of gold. The Egyptian Mines Exploration group are firm as the

                        devoir de vous rappeler que si la Société porte le titre d’Union Artistique
                        Française au lien d’Union Artistique Internationale, o’est paroe que d’après
                        les Statuts son programme est français, la Société ayant été fondée dans le
                        seul et nni que bat de donner aux étrangers la facilité de se familiariser
                        aveo la laugne française. </p>
                    <p>Voilk pourquoi le Comité, souoieux des in. térêts qui lui sont oonfiés, fait
                        tous ses efforts ponr amener, en dehors de la colonie française, les antres
                        nationaux sans distinction d’origine k adhérer k notre programme. </p>
                    <p>La présence de oes derniers dans notre groupement noas est d'autant pins
                        préciéase qu’elle nous permet de réaliser l’idéal des Fondateurs. </p>
                    <p>C’est ainsi, par exemple, qu’k la dernière soirée donnée k rEden, Bit 8

                    <p>En somme, sans les Etrangers notre Société n’aurait plus sa raison d’être. </p>
                    <p>Il résulte que si notre programme est français, la Sooiété est au fond

                    <head>Allenburys' DIET</head>
                    <p>The "Allenburys" DIET is a complete milk and farinaceous Food, easy of
                        assimilation, most agreeable to take, simply and quickly made. It is
                        recommended in place of ordinary milk foods, gruel, etc., and whilst
                        acceptable to all as a light nourishment, it is particularly helpful to
                        Dyspeptics, Invalids and the Aged. In the sick-room it will be found
                        invaluable and it is easily and quickly made, the addition of boiling water
                        only being necessary. </p>
                    <p>The "Allenburys" DIET is readily digested by tose who are unable to take
                        cow's milk and is particularly serviceable in convalescence. When taken as a
                        light supper diet it will be found to promote tranquil and refreshing sleep.
                        Although this DIET is a good for ADULTS and is entirely distinct fom the
                        "Allenburys" Foods for Infants, yet it is also of great value as a
                        restorative food for young children, especially during convalescence. </p>

                    <p>To the Editor op the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,—I am desired by Her Royal Highness Princess Christian, President,
                        and the Committee, to ask if you will be so kind as to insert the enclosed
                        appeal, signed by Her Royal Highness, in your valuable columns. </p>
                    <p>You will see from a perusal of it that it is an essentially National
                        movement, in which Princess Christian is taking an active and deep interest.
                        She has promised to preside at an important meeting at the Memorial Hall,
                        Farringdon Street, on November 18th, and is sending a personal invitation to
                        the Mayors of the various towns of the United Kingdom to attend it </p>
                    <p>I also enclose for your perusal a reprint of the leading article which
                        appeared in the London “Daily Telegraph” of June 26th last which deals with
                        the subject in a very succinct form, and if yon can draw attention to the
                        appeal in your editorial columns, my Committee would be very grateful. </p>
                    <p>I am, Faithfully yours, E. Douglas White.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">To the Editor op the Egyptian Gazette.</hi></p>
                    <p>Sir,—An organisation has been formed to carry out the above-named important
                        object. How important it is can best be realised by a consideration of
                        statistics which Dr. Latham submitted at the last Annual Meeting of the
                        Hospital Saturday Fund. He stated that in London alone 16,000 persons die
                        every year whose valuable lives might be saved with proper treatment, to say
                        nothing of the thousands who are slowly moving to their doom. </p>
                    <p>Again, taking London by itself, he computes that no less than 80,000 of its
                        popu lation are stricken with one form or another of tuberculosis, and makes
                        the startling deduction that one in every sixty-five will be dead in five
                        years’ time from a preventable disease. </p>
                    <p>The monetary loss to the industrial classes is appalling, and though there
                        are no actual figures to go by, some comparative idea can he formed by the
                        estimate, which Dr. Herman Briggs, the well-known health officer of New
                        York, calculates cost £66,000,000 annually to the United States. </p>
                    <p>Owing to the work of the Poor Law Unions and the few Consumption Hospitals
                        and the National Association for the Prevention of Consumption, in which His
                        Majesty the King takes a deep personal interest, the death rate from
                        tuberculosis has been reduced during the last sixty years by no less than
                        two-thirds, which means a saving of 75,000 lives a year. </p>
                    <p>The National Committee, of which Her Royal Highness Princess Christian is
                        President has been established under the auspices of the Hospital Saturday
                        Fund, for the establishment of Sanatoria for workers suffering from
                        tuberculosis ; it is an exceptionally representative body, including
                        delegates from practically all the great Friendly Societies and Trades
                        Unions, and the work is receiving enthusiastic support in all directions. </p>
                    <p>The Special Appeal Committee consists of Her Royal Highness Princess
                        Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, Her Highness Princess Victoria of
                        Schleswig-Holstein. the Duchess of Somerset, the Marchioness of Londonderry,
                        the Earl and Countess Cadogan, the Earl and Countess of Derby, the Bishop of

                        £50,000 to provide the building and acquire the site for a first sanatorium
                        for the accommodation of 200 patients. About £6,000 has already been
                        promised, and a suitable site has been secured at Benenden, Kent. </p>
                    <p>The various Societies and Trades Unions guarantee the cost of maintenance,
                        but under the terms of their constitution, they can only make small
                        donations towards the building and purchase of land. The Sanatorium,
                        therefore, will be self-supporting, and no appeal for funds will ever be
                        made to the public again. </p>
                    <p>The following extract from Dr. Latham’s address is extremely interesting from
                        the economic point of view : — </p>
                    <p>“Mr. Alfred Chapman and Mr. Russell, of " the Ancient Order of Foresters,
                        have made " an important investigation into the cost of " consumption to a
                        single Court of the Ancient " Order of Foresters. The result of this inves “
                        tigation is so striking that there is reason to " hopes that all the
                        Friendly and Allied Socie-" ties will make exhaustive enquiries into the "
                        subject. Mr. Russell finds that the average his Court is three times as
                        great as the pay to any person dying from another disease. A man dying from
                        consumption costs the Society £21, and a man dying from another disease
                        costs £7.” </p>
                    <p>In pressing this appeal, enough has been said to bring home to the public the
                        awful condition of things which this movement is organised to cope with ; no
                        words are needed to make it more impressive—the pathos lies in the figures
                        quoted above. In this sense it must appeal personally to every one, but it
                        gains additional force, in that, it is economically sound and its working is
                        based on the principles which govern the great industrial Benefit Societies,
                        and applies the sound principle of thrift to the greatest of all blessings,
                        health. It is is a practical movement against one of the worst scourges of
                        our country, and in this sense becomes a truly national one. </p>
                    <p>The Special Appeal Committee earnestly invite employers of labour, Trades
                        Unions and Friendly Societies who have not yet joined the movement, to do
                        so. The Secretary, Mr. E. Douglas White, will be pleased to give fall
                        particulars to any one applying to him. </p>

                    <p>At Chelsea House to day, with the Princess Christian presiding, the
                        preliminary steps will be taken by the National Committee for the
                        Establishment of Sanatoria for Workers suffering from Tuberculosis towards
                        bringing the project for which it was formed to wider public notice. The
                        benefits of open-air treatment, especially in the earlier stages of this
                        dire scourge, are now folly recognized, though unfortunately at present the
                        means of cure are too limited, and many have to put up with inadequate and
                        incomplete methods of treatment. This Committee, which has Princess
                        Christian as its President, includes a very large number of well-known names
                        in the list of its Vice-Presidents and active supporters, among them being
                        the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Duke and Duchess of Portland, the Duke and
                        Duchess of Westminster, Earl and Countess Cadogan, the Bishop of London,
                        Lord Burnham, Sir Savile Crossley, Mr. A. J. Balfour, M.P., Mr. Joseph
                        Chamberlain, M.P., Lord and Lady Cheylesmore, the Hon. Harry Lawson, M.P.,
                        and Mrs. Lawson, Lord and Lady Iveagh, the Chief Rabbi, Sir William
                        Broadbent, and Mr. and Mrs. Leopold de Rothschild. The co-operation of the
                        great Provident and Friendly Societies has been secured, as it is the
                        primary aim of the effort to he entirely Self-supporting when once
                        established. Hence upon the Committee are representatives of such
                        well-reputed Societies as the Ancient Order of Foresters, the Independent
                        Order of Foresters, the Independent Order of Oddfellows, the Hearts of Oak,
                        the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, the Fawcett Association
                        (General Post Office), the Hospital Saturday Fund, the Board of Guardians
                        for the Relief of the Jewish Poor, the London Society of Compositors, and
                        many more. </p>
                    <p>The speakers at the meeting will include Earl Cadogan, the Bishop of Stepney,
                        Dr. Acland, Mr. Garland (Chairman of the Committee), and Mr. Bunn (Secretary
                        of the Hospital Saturday Fond). Details will then be given concerning the
                        scheme, which, briefly, is to erect a first sanatorium for the accommodation
                        of 200 patients. It is to be upon a scale simpler and less expensive than
                        has yet been tried, and it is believed that many of those who seek its early
                        aid will he not only capable of, but actually benefited by doing, light farm
                        work, by which it will be made self-supporting. A most promising site has
                        been secured at Benenden, in Kent, and the total estimated cost for its
                        purchase and for putting up suitable premises is £50,000. After this, the
                        various Societies co-operating will contribute towards the maintenance of
                        their own exertions. About £2000 is already promised. According to present
                        intentions, a monster mass meeting is to take place in the autumn to bring
                        the project directly to the notice of working people. </p>
                    <p>On Thursday next, at Chelsea House, under the Presidency of her Royal
                        Highness Princess Christian, with Lord Cadogan as Chairman, will be held a
                        meeting to further a philanthropic movement of a novel and most promising
                        character. The movement is novel in the sense that it combines two
                        well-known principles, both of which flourish separately in this country,
                        but which are rarely, if ever, found in combination. The object is primarily
                        to fight the great White Plague - as Tuberculosis is grimly but
                        appropriately called—as is done in many Institutions scattered over the
                        country supported by voluntary contributions. What differentiates the aims
                        of the “National Committee-for the Establishment of Sanatoria for Workers
                        suffering from Tuberculosis” is this: After the initial expense—only some
                        fifty thousand pounds—of acquiring land and erecting the necessary buildings
                        has been raised by the liberality of the munificent, the whole main-tenance
                        of the Institution will be paid for by the class for whose benefit it will
                        exist, through the medium of the great Friendly Societies, Trade Unions and
                        other cognate organizations. This is really a new departure, to which,
                        perhaps, the nearest parallel is the Rowton Houses system. The effort is an
                        economic as well as a charitable one, and as soon as the material fabric has
                        been erected and paid for, the charitable will never be called upon to
                        subscribe again. On the other hand, the self-respect of the working-classes
                        will be maintained at a high level, because those who profit by the
                        advantages offered to them will be conscious that they owe the opportunity,
                        not to charity, but to their own qualities of thrift and providence. Most
                        people are aware, in a general way, of the ravages of consumption and other
                        forms of tuberculosis, but few realize how deadly and devastating this
                        scourge is. For instance, how many who read this article grasp the awful
                        truth that tuberculosis kills one victim in England and Wales every five
                        minutes Every twenty-four honrs of the year, on an average day, there die
                        two hundred and eighty-eight human beings in England and Wales of a disease
                        which, in its earlier stages at least, is curable. This is no wild
                        guesswork, but an inexorable conclusion drawn, as Dr La-thom told the
                        Committee of the Hospital Saturday Fund at the annual meeting two months
                        ego, from the unimpeachable statistics of the Registrar General. A death
                        list such as this, from a colliery accident or a shipwreck, would occupy
                        public attention for Weeks ; and yet, day in and day out, this curable
                        disease carries off all but three hundred victims. Dr. Lathom farther tells
                        us that in London alone we have to day forty thousand persons—the strength
                        of an army corps—suffering from consumption and if we include all forms of
                        tuberculosis, the total of the working-classes is double that of the
                        population of London as a whole. And Dr. Lathom puts the case in this
                        startling but too well confirmed form : “Of the working-class - men, women,
                        and ohildren-whom yon meet in the streets of London to-day—at least one in
                        thirty three will be dead within five years from taberculosis.” These are
                        sober facts which may well stagger humanity. </p>
                    <p>It is not, of course, contended that treatment at the earliest appreciable
                        stage of the disease in the best-equipped sanatoria will extinguish this
                        colossal death-roll. Medical science, with its magnificent record of
                        marvellous achievements to give it confidence. does anticipate that in time
                        tuberculosis will be the name of an almost obsolete plague But physicians
                        are certain-with a certainty born of actual experience-that a reduction of
                        at least one-half, or even two-thirds, can be effected at a cost which would
                        not only increase the liabilities of the great Friendly Societies, but would
                        actually diminish them. Messrs. Russell and Chapman, who speak with the
                        highest authority on the financial position of the Ancient Order of Free
                        Forester, have given us the result of their investigation into the cost of
                        consumption to a single Court of the Order. They say that “the average cost
                        of sick pay to a consumptive member of this Court is three time as great as
                        the pay to any person dying from another disease. A man dying from
                        consumption costs the Society twenty-one pounds, and a man dying from an
                        other disease costs seven pounds” </p>
                    <p>Nor is this all we have to go by Dr Lathom, and there is no more trustworthy
                        authority, made the following statement to the Board of the Hospital
                        Saturday Fund in the address from which we have already quoted— "As many of
                        you are aware, a law was passed in Germany some years back which compelled
                        every one with an income of less than one hundred pounds per annum to insure
                        against for a few years the insurance companies were heavily hit by
                        consumption, At least one person in every three who drew sick pay from them
                        was suffering from tuberculosis. The companies investigated the matter
                        thoroughly. They sought medical advice, and were told that the most hopeful
                        treatment of consumption was by means of efficient sanatoria. They were,
                        moreover, told that if no treatment were attempted, possibly two
                        consumptives in every ten would be cured by natural means, but if patients
                        were sent in a sufficiently early stage to sanatoria, seven out of ten would
                        have the disease arrested. The chairman of one of the principal German
                        insurance companies proved that if one hundred and forty-out of five hundred
                        consumptives could be so far. restored to health as to do without sick pay
                        for one year, this would be sufficient to recoup the company for their
                        treatment in a sanatorium, or for the erection and maintenance of an
                        institution of its own. Consequently, the German insurance companies erected
                        sanatoria for their clients, and so satisfied are the business men with the
                        results, that they are extending the system.” </p>
                    <p>Already the idea, which is the object of this meeting on Thursday to promote,
                        has caught on with the leaders of the great Friendly Societies, Trade Unions
                        and other similar organisations. Mr. Garland, who is well known as a
                        representative of the Poet Office employees, has obtained the consent of the
                        Postmaster-General to a reduction of two shillings a year from the pay of
                        all employés willing to give their consent, and it is hoped that a
                        sufficient sum will thus be raised to endow fifty beds for postmen, sorters,
                        and other servants of the Poet Office. </p>
                    <p>Of course, it will at once be asked, why do not the Friendly Societies find
                        the money for building sanatoria of their own t The answer is simple ; that,
                        under the existing Friendly Societies Acts, the different Boards may not
                        employ their accumulated funds in other than the strictly limited and
                        scheduled way. But if this inexpensive experiment proves a success— as it is
                        practically certain to do—the Friendly Societies will be stimulated to have
                        the Acts controlling their employment of funds relaxed so as to enable them
                        to build sanatoria for themselves, or to endow beds in existing
                        institutions. </p>
                    <p>Our reason for calling attention to this meritorious scheme (details of which
                        can be acquired by applying to the Secretary, at the Offices, 54. Gray’s Inn
                        Road, W.C.) is that it seeks to cope with a terrible and increasing evil, by
                        aid of remedies the efficacy of which has been demonstrated on a large
                        scale, and on economic principles which must induce the working-man to
                        protect himself, at a very slight cost, against a disease which is more than
                        decimating the class of which he is a member. </p>
