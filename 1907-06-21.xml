                    <head>TROUBLES IN FRANCE</head>
                    <p>The telegrams we publish today show no diminution in the anarhy prevailing in
                        the South of France. The wine-growers and the people dependent upon them
                        number about two and a half millions. Montpellier, the centre of the whole
                        movement, is a small provincial town. Yet within the space of a day it was
                        called upon to give hospitality to at least three-quarters of a million
                        souls, who had gathered to protest against the French Government's
                        non-alleciation of distress. The outcome of that meeting has had an
                        extraordinary result. M. Marcellin Albert, who has been styled the 'Messiah
                        of the Midi,' so influenced the gathering that it pledged itself to hold
                        together to the last, and to defend the wine industry by every means in its
                        power.</p>
                    <p>Following upon this general declatation came the announcement that the South
                        of France viticulteurs would pay no taxes until their grivances had been
                        promised redress. That reminds us of our passive-resistance crusade at home,
                        but the French are impulsive, and were not even satisfied with their
                        determination not to contribute to the revenue. Therefore they gave
                        definitiveness to their movement by planning the collapse of the whole
                        machinery of local government in the districts affected. The fact that this
                        was no mere piece of effervescent emotionalist is corroborated by the news
                        that the municipalities have resigned and the municipal employees have
                        struck work.</p>
                    <p>The Southern revolt has reached a crisis, violence is feared, and troops are
                        being drafted into the area affected. The population's strike – for it is
                        nothing less – has been accompanied with some dramatic scenes. At Narbonne
                        the Mayor dissolved the municipal body at sunset, the church bells and the
                        fire-station having been employed to sound the tocsin. On the balcony of the
                        Town Hall, Councillor after Councillor removed his insignia and threw it
                        into the Market-place. The tricolour was torn from the flagstaff, and its
                        place was taken by a large black flag. In face of this action, the French
                        Government appears to be paralysed. It cannot remedy the distress by the
                        negative means advised. Vine growers are, of course, starving amid their
                        fruitful vineyards. But the fault is not to be laid against the Government,
                        but to economic causes. Fraud, adulteration, and grape subsitutes made from
                        sugar, and are, therefore, met by opposition from the beet-sugar growers,
                        who fear the shutting down of their market. Thus, there is no prospect of
                        effecting a speedy cure for the distresses of the people of the Midi.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN RULERS SPRING-CLEANED</head>
                    <p>Of course, it is quite right and proper that the Egyptians at the British
                        Museum should be spring-cleaned. But it stikes one as rather unseemly that
                        they should be spring-cleaned like ordinary mortals, as through they had not
                        existed some thousands of years ago, before pure water and fresh air had
                        become such a mania as at present. A Nile was the least we could offer them
                        for their ablutions, and for a towel – white samite is the only material
                        that sounds imposing enough. And yet it is to be feared that a pail, a cake
                        of yellow soap, and and the common pump, or tap, are more probable than all
                        these. Perhaps the British Museum authorities have something saponaceous,
                        more in the style of ambrosia – there is no term for "soap for the gods."
                        For one cannot think that Isis and Osiris or Thothmes or Rameses could be
                        submitted to the indignity of the ordinary cleansing process, which might
                        just as well be applied to any schoolboy.</p>

                            from all parts. The Italians were maltreated and eventually they and the
                            cabman were arrested. It was half an hour before any shawish or ghaffir

                            The performance by the four little hoys, which was brilliantly

                            instruments as musicians ; it was certainly the most amusing piece of
                            the performance. Miss Ns Purvis accompanied several pieces, and her
                            careful playing showed her to be a very good pianist for her age. Miss
                            Cesana accompanied the sung “Won’t you buy my pretty flowers,” which was
                            prettily sung by Mias Nanine Roberts, and her sweet voice gives great

                    <p>SIR E. CASSELL AND UNION BANK</p>
                    <p>ALEXANDRIA BOURSE CLOSED</p>
                    <p>The worse has come to the worst and the Cassa di Sconto e di Risparmio at
                        Alexandria and Cairo has closed its doors. The scene in the purlieus of the
                        Alexandria Bourse was peculiarly animated this morning ; agitated groups of
                        every race and kind discussed the situation and all sorts of rumours were
                        bruited about. The members of the Committee of the Alexandria Stock and
                        Sharebrokers Associations hastily assembled and came to the decision that in
                        view of the extreme gravity of the situation extraordinary measures must be
                        imperatively taken. The Association therefore decided that the stock and
                        share Bourse of Alexandria should be closed and that it should not be opened
                        again until the situation of the Cassa di Sconto e di Risparmio had been
                        accurately determined. This momentous step was taken because it was feared
                        that if business was conducted as usual this morning, the closing of the
                        Bank would lead to a heavy fall all round owing to panic stricken sellers
                        throwing vast quantities of securities on the market. Owing to the
                        continuous fall, the scarcity of buyers, and the general want of confidence
                        that prevails, it was thought that an unprecedented catastrophe would ensue
                        if the market remained open. The Bourse of Alexandria will he closed
                        therefore until further notice.</p>
                    <p>The closing of the Alexandria Bourse is the sabject of diverse criticism. On
                        th.e one hand ‘the Committee are censured for having resorted So such an
                        extreme measure, as it is considered that it will have a very bad effect on
                        the opinion of London and Paris, and the money markets of Europe generally,
                        which will at once jump to the conclusion that the state of Affairs is far
                        more disastrous than it actually is and there will be a universal rush to
                        get rid of Egyptian securities. On the other hand it is alleged that such a
                        measure as the closing of the Bourse has often been resorted coin the cases
                        of second-rate bourses, as for example, that of Constantinople, and as
                        moreover sound financial opinion in London and Paris does not take the
                        Alexandria Bourse very seriously, it does not really matter much one way or
                        the other.</p>
                    <p>I The interest has been now shifted from Alexandria and Vienna to London. One
                        of the directors of the Union Bank at Vienna Arrives at London this evening
                        in order to confer with Sir Ernest Cassell and the important group
                        interested in the National Bank of Egypt. Sir Ernest is interesting himself
                        in the matter and the result of the deliberations, which are about to take
                        place in London, will be anxiously awaited in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman of the Board of. Directors of the Union Bank has left Vienna and
                        is arriving at Alexandria by the Austrian Lloyd steamer, on Monday next. He
                        will examine the position of the Cassa di Sconto e di Risparmio.</p>

                    <p>Beyrouth, June 14, 1907.</p>
                    <p>The Russian Consul General Prine Gagarine and the Princess his wife arrived
                        on Wednesday morning by the Russian mail steamer from Constantinople. By the
                        same steamer arrived also Prince and Princess Tcherkowski. Prince
                        Tcherkowski has just been appointed Russian Consul at Damascus where a few
                        years previously he had been as vice-consul. </p>
                    <p>Madame Wassa Pasha widow of the late Governor of the Lebanon sailed this
                        morning by the Messageries "Senegal" for Constantinople. A crowd of
                        distinguished friends accompanied her on board with floral tributes. Madame
                        Wassa Pasha has been for a few weeks a welcome guest at her friend's Madame
                        Habib Dumani, and had come out to Beyrout with her two sons Selim and Said
                        Bey to visit the tomb of her late husband, and see the land where she has
                        been the object of so much honor. The many invitations she has from several
                        distinguished people, both Christian and Druse, in the Lebanon, who had been
                        known to the late Mutessarif, speak well for the latter's faithful and
                        disinterested remembrance of past favours. It must be said that Madame Wassa
                        by her charmingly unaffected and kind ways contributed also to the
                        inspiration of such spontaneous welcome.</p>
                    <p>In the list of distinguished arrivals should certainly be included that of
                        Madame Albert Fouques Duparc, the sympathetic wife of the highly esteemed
                        French Consul General, who arrived this morning by the welcomed by a host of
                        distinguished people and all the consular staff.</p>
                    <p>Miss Helen Gould, the celebrated American milliardiare and philanthropist,
                        has during her recent visit to Beyrout after a trip in the Holy Land, been
                        invited to the Syrian Protestant College. Miss Gould evinced a lively
                        interest in this grand institution and in view of the friendship that exists
                        between her and Mrs. Russell Sage, who lately endowed the College with the
                        liberal sum of 50,000 dollars, it is hoped that a noble sense of emulation
                        will divert thereto a part of the universal and immense charities to which
                        this noble lady has been vowing her life and fortune.</p>
                    <p>By the death of the agent of the Russian Steam Navigation Company, Mr.
                        Nicholas Catzeflis, a noble character prematurely disappeared. The deceased
                        was distinguished by a fearless frankness and an uncompromising attitude
                        towards sham traits that challenge particular notice in the smooth-tongued
                        East. Despite a certain sourness that marked sometimes his demeanour, and
                        that was caused by his chronic gastci trouble, his refined intelligence and
                        sterling qualities won him a large circle of distinguished friends, as the
                        imposing funeral attended by most of the Consuls General, testified. The
                        late Mr. Catzeeflis was acting agent for the Russian Steam Navigation
                        Company at Alexandria a few years, and the capable and scrupulous manner in
                        which the helped the Customs authorities at that port to fight the subtle
                        hasheesh contrabandists won him the esteen and sympathetic friendship of
                        Chitty Bey, whose name will for ever live in the annals of the Egyptian
                        Customs. </p>
                    <p>A suspected case of plague having occurred at Amsheet, a village a few miles
                        to the North of Junieh, the well known port of the Lebanon, the Mutessarif
                        Muzaffer Pasha wired to the Vali of Beyrout and the Board of Health at
                        Constantinople accordingly. The Sanitary Inspector here delegated the
                        Lazaretto doctor to the sport to make an examination of the case and report
                        thereon. The result of this examination having been negative, culture and
                        innoculation were resorted to by way of confirmatory evidence and we are
                        pleased to state that a negative pronouncement has definitely been made. The
                        incidence of the case under the circustances and at such a comperatively
                        isolated village was calculated make one anticipate such a result. </p>

                        on the position of the Company, whose parlous state is now causing a great
                        deal of grave anxiety at Alexandria, should arouse the board of directors of
                        that concern to a sense of their responsibilities. The Company in question
                        is one of the very many, which have lately been floated in Egypt but
                        registered in Loudon for the purpose of evading the regulations laid down by
                        the Egyptian Government in respect of founders shares. The proposition of
                        the directors to offer in settlement of their liability the cancellation of
                        all operations in the shares, by the collection or payment of the difference
                        on all transactions, basing the value at par, is absolutely inadmissible as
                        the shares are now practically valtfefass. If the shareholders are so dead
                        to their own interests as to permit of such a proposition they deserve no
                        pity. The Company is an English one and amenable to the Companies Act, and
                        ft will be therefore no difticult matter to set the law in motion in the
                        British Consular Court at Alexandria. The subjects of other nations,
                        benefiting by the- Capitulations, who abuse their privileges by keeping
                        gambling hells or disorderly houses,have of late led Lord Cromer to demand
                        the reform of the Capitulations. But these offences are venial compared with
                        that of using the Capitulations to start English Companies, in order that
                        the directors may evade their responsabilities, thereby bringing disaster on
                        hundreds and thousands of unfortunate speculators and investors. The scandal
                        of foisting English Companies on the Egyptian public has become very grave
                        during the last few months. The Companies Act of 1900 may be very will
                        suited for a country like England where the business and financial instincts
                        of the people have been cultivated for centuries. But the liberty accorded
                        by this Act is totally unsuited to Egypt, where there is a public, who know
                        little of finance, bat who are impregnated with an extraordinarily keen love
                        of gambling. An example should be made to show that the stringency of the
                        Companies Act is as severely upheld in the British Consular Courts in Egypt
                        as it is in the High Courts of Justice. The English are the trustees of
                        Egypt and we should not permit the law of our own land to be used as a
                        convenient cloak for unscrupulous company promoters and directors, at the
                        expense of the ignorant inhabitants of Egypt In the case of the Company,
                        which was the object of your animadversions, here is an excellent
                        opportunity for showing Egypt that English Law cannot be treated with
                        contempt by directors eager to evade their responsibilities. The law ought
                        to be put in motion and the responsibilities brought home. It Will be an
                        excellent precedent for other occasions in the near future.</p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.”</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,—I fully endorse the remarks made by “English resident” with regard
                        to the bathing place at Cleopatra, but feel that he is doing the “Good
                        Jesuit. Fathers” and their noble intentions too much honour, if for one
                        moment he ventures to think that bathers might be detered, by notices or
                        other impedimenta put up on the spot by the said “Good Fathers” from using
                        the pool. Well, Sir, I for one, and with me several friends, have not
                        thought it worth to take the slightest notice of the “Jesuit Fathers”
                        warnings, be they in the shape of notices or white handkerchiefs. In fact,
                        the only thing I regretted when the notice of the “charitable Fathers”
                        struck my eyes, was that no pot of black paint and brush was at hand, when I
                        should have written something across the “Notice Board” just to enlighten
                        the “Good Jesuit Fathers” on the question of Christian Love and Charity.
                        However, other hands were more radical and simply pulled the board down
                        without further ado. And well they did. Of course, this only goes to show
                        how manifold the ways are to do good “ad majorem Dei gloriam.”</p>
                    <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette ” Dear Sir,—It has long been in my
                        mind to trespass on your kindness for the insertion of a complaint on a
                        subject which, I am convinced, is a very general source of annoyance. I
                        refer to the assemblies held by boabs every night at the doors of the
                        premises whose well-being is fallaciously supposed to be their “ raison
                        d’être. ” These assemblies generally last well into the small hours, and the
                        unfortunate residents are afflicted with noisy discussions in the Berberine
                        dialect which banish sleepand induce a fiendish desire for vengeance on the
                        offenders. The abatement of this nuisance is a matter of considerable
                        importance and it would be interesting to know how to set about it : same of
                        the more vigorous members of the community abate it in.a summary manner with
                        a thick stick, and are free from annoyance for a certain period, but this
                        course is not to be recommended from a law abiding point of view, and a
                        practical .solution is highly necessary, backed up by the power of the law
                        It would be interesting to hear other peoples’ views on the subject, but at
                        the same time unless a practical result is arrived at the ventilation of
                        opinions will be futile.</p>

                    <p>UNDERGOING SPRING-CLEANING</p>
                    <p>Following upon the sacrilegious invasion of the studiouR calm ot the British
                        Museum reading-room by the brush and scraper of the decorator, which sent a
                        sad troop of disconsolate literary “ghosts” wandering in the outer
                        wilderness, the spring-cleaning charwoman or charman has laid an unwonted
                        hand upon the Court of the Egyptian kings.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday the aspect of the gloomy gallery was strange and ununsual. It is
                        the mission in life of the spring-cleaner, male or female, to track down
                        dirt and dust and to eradicate them with an unsparing and vandal hand.</p>
                    <p>The result.proves that a liberal application of pure water is as good for
                        Egyptian relics as for more modern articles. Those who visit the Egyptian
                        Court in future will observe on the granite countenance of the colossal head
                        of Thothmes III., who was King of Egypt a mat ter of 3,500 years ago, a
                        blush of health and the suspicion of a granite smile not previously
                        noticeable. Sekhet, the fire goddess and the “Smiter of the Anti,” can now
                        be seen in all the beauty of her highly-polished black granite. Most of the
                        effigies of this goddess, who is generally represented holding the “symbol
                        of life,” are in black granite, and the virtue that lies in a good wash is
                        particularly noticeable in her case.</p>
                    <p>The monuments of the Egyptian kings and deities, that lend such grim
                        solemnity to this section of the museum, have long been accused of
                        uncleanliness They carry the incrustation of the dust of the desert, which
                        has been a cumulating since the world was young, and which has been
                        considerably added to since they took up their dwelling in London.
                        Travellers declare that the monuments that are retained in Egypt are
                        considerably cleaner than those in this country This stigma is now being
                        removed, and the grime of centuries is beginning to fall from the shoulders
                        of Hathor, the “Queen of all the gods j” from Menthu-ra, the “dwellerin
                        Thebes from Hapi, the “god of the Nile,” and from Isis, Osiris, and Amen ra,
                        Rameses, Amenhetep, and other Egyptian potentates, who have slept too long
                        in their cloaks of dirt, are beginning to be seen in new and unsuspected
                        colours, and the hieroglyphics that adorn the granite sarcophagi are
                        becoming vastly more intelligible to earnest Egyptologists</p>

                    <p>The first export of perforated bricks from Cyprus to Egypt has taken place
                        this week, the Ceramic Company of Limassol (Sooiété Anonyme Céramique)
                        having just despatched 300,000 of these bricks to Alexandria. A large part
                        of these bricks have been ordered from Egypt. These bricks are very light
                        and are of great use for the upper stories of houses. Up to now these bricks
                        have been imported into Egypt from Marseilles but it is hoped in Cyprus that
                        there will soon develop a large export from Limassol. The Company have begun
                        to manufacture French tiles with a view to export. The quality of the work
                        turned out from the Limassol factory is excellent and owiug to the1 cheap

                        following statement of the reasons for his sudden retirement from the anny,
                        which was announced in our special telegram of the 12th inst. :—</p>
                    <p>"Why have I retired ? Well, I liave not retired voluntarily from the Army, in
                        which I have served since I was a boy of seventeen. 1 have not retired on
                        account of old age, for I liave still some thirteen years before the age
                        clause would affect me in my present rank. I have not retired because the
                        Promotion Board did not think me worthy of promotion, for I was promoted
                        last year.</p>
                    <p>“ I have retired simply because the British authorities have offered me no
                        employment since I was turned out—yes, I prefer the words 1 turned ont —from
                        the Canadian Militia for ealling attention to political corruption in the
                        appointment of officers—corruption that, if not protested against by
                        someone, would be bound to destroy the efficiency of that fine body of men.
                        For I consider unfairness and favouritism is bound to destroy efficiency and
                        take the heart out of any military force.”</p>

                    <p>Lovers of Egypt and scenes Egyptian should not miss the unique opportunity
                        that is now being presented at Messers. McLeans' galleries of picking up at
                        a moderate price some charming mementoes of the land of the Pharaohs. Miss
                        Hadden and Miss McCracken both shew an intimate acquaintance with their
                        subject, and their pictures reveal the true spirit of the East, without
                        being marred by the meretricious gaudiness which so ofter stamps this calss
                        of work, being soft in tone and not too high in colouring. Miss Hadden has
                        confined herself almost entirely to animals, and with no little success,
                        notably in (20). </p>
                    <p>“Types of Cairo Donkeys” and (27). A “study in expression,” this latter being
                        in our opinion a unique bit of animal portraiture. She would seem to be more
                        successful where she treats heads only, than where she takes in the whole
                        animal, this being due perhaps to an inadequate study of anatomy. Nos. (25)
                        and (26) are worthy of special mention, being paintings of Hathor, Mistress
                        of the West painted by permission in the Cairo Museum. She has not confined
                        herself entirely to Egyptian subjects and we cannot resist mentioning her
                        picture of Penguins at the London Zoo, which displays a keen sense of humour
                        as well ss an accurate eye for bird life in the artist. Miss McCracken has

                        pictures we can but praise the general level of excellence of them all ;
                        they speak to one ot the East without being, if we may be pardoned the
                        phrase, offensively Eastern. There is neither exaggeration nor glare about
                        them. If we had to select any particular one for praise our choice fall on
                        (32) Brass Bazaar, Cairo, but all are exclient and the show as a whole is
                        well worth a visit from anyone who loves Egypt and appreciates a faithful
                        depiction of its charms.</p>

                    <head>MISSION WORK AMONG SYRIANS</head>
                    <p>The annual meeting of the Archbishop's Mission to the Assyrian Christians was
                        held last week at Lambeth Palace. The Archbishop of Canterbury, who
                        presided, said that this movement aimed, not at converting peoglé to our
                        mode of faith, but at strengthening and restoring perhaps the most ancient
                        Christian community in the world. The outlook had never been so hopeful as
                        now. These people were on both sides of the frontier, and now more on the
                        Turkish than on the Persian side. The mission’s work at Urmi was, therefore,
                        being transferred to Van. There were interesting movements in connexion with
                        Oriental Churches generally which made it specially desirable to strengthen
                        the work at the centre of this mission. In India there were certainly
                        500,000 Syrian Christians, now divided into discordant and contending sects
                        ; and their best men were seeking Anglican co-operation in arranging that
                        their episcopal life should be under the guidance of a Bishop ordained by
                        the Patriarch, with whom this mission was working. It was a difficult and
                        complicated question, but a report made by the Rev. W.H. Browne, of this
                        mission, on his visit to the Syrians in India gave great hope of suocess.
                        The mission’s work was also becoming better understood by other bodies of
                        Oriental Christians. That great body, the Jacobite Church, was feeling its
                        way towards getting some guidance and stimulus from the Anglicans. At his
                        request, the Rev. O.H. Parry, the outgoing head of the mission, had been
                        visiting the Jacobite authorities and discussing possibilities. The
                        Armenians, too, were discussing the question of possible intercommunion.
                        Those who had studied the questioA would say that a good many of the
                        Oriental sects owed their independence rather to national sympathies and
                        characteristics than to any determined adherenoe to heretical or doubtful
                        creeds or usages. This mission should be recognized as not merely keeping on
                        their legs a folk who would otherwise collapse, but an setting forward the
                        great cause of unity in the Church of Christ The importance of the work was
                        altogether out of proportion to the funds.</p>

                    <p>Au Stock Exchange, le Consolide anglais a baisse avant-hier de 1/8 83 7/8.

                    <p>est remontee de 1/4 a 104 1/4. La National Bank a encore perdu 1/4 de livre a

                    <p>Ici, le marche a repris, ce matin, une phy- sionomie convenable, sinon tout a
                        fait regnliere. La seance a bien encore ete ouvertepar un discours, mais
                        court et nullement dans le genre de ceux qui avaient marque lesjouritees de
                        jeudi et vendredi derniers. De plus, ce speech a officiel, prononce par le
                        president interimaire de l’honorable Corporation des agents de change. Stir
                        un ton onctuenx et pa­terae, M. Paul Oziol a engage ces messieurs de la
                        corbeille a ne pas se laisser influencer par les nouvelles pessimistes
                        repandues par les bais- siers sur le compte d’une seciete fonciere et d’un
                        etablissement de banque, nouvelles qne le president de la Corporation a
                        declarees po- sitivement fausses. M. Paul Oziol a termine sa harangue par
                        quelques bonnes paroles prechant la concorde etl'union, voire la “
                        cooperation a l’ceuvre commune. ”</p>
                    <p>Nous allions oublier de dire que, d’ordre du Comite, la duree des seances a
                        ete fixee a une heure, au lieu d’une demie. Toutes les opera- rations
                        pratiquees sont de nouveau enregis- trdes. Les teneurs de carnet ont ete

                        n’.emeuvent profondement personne, par suite de leur ca- ractfcre febrile.
                        L’opinion prevaut, d’ailleurs, que le Comite prend decidement trop de
                        mesures hatives. Le calme et la circonspection ne sauraient nuire a aucun
                        interet, pas meme a ceux de la respectable Corporation. Il faudrait autant
                        que possible s’attacher a ne pas res- treindro la liberty des transactions,
                        a ne pas tomber dans l’arbitraire et laisser les choses suivre leur cours
                        naturel, d’autantplus que le fond de baisse est presque attaint et qn’en

                    <p>Le nombre des transactions en registries a ete de 64. La National Bank a

                    <p>Nous detachons d’une correspondance de Londres, en date du 9 Juin, le passage
                        suivant :</p>
                    <p>“ La situation du marche monetaire n est pas satisfnisante. On remarque trop
                        d’exporta- tions d'or, et l'argent au lendemain est cher et difficile. Les
                        Banques “ ramassent ’’,a Paris surtout, par suite de la toumure inquietante
                        que prennent de Russie.</p>
                    <p>“ Au Stock Exchange, les transactions sont presque nulles en presence de la
                        chert? de l'argent. Les capitalistes en quite de place­ments continuent a
                        rester a l'ecart; seuls les baissiere sont en plein dans leur ?l?ment.
                        L’inquietude et le malaise sont partout ; on s’attend a une bien mauvaise
                        liquidation et a des chutes provoquees par les r?centes fail- lites. ”</p>

                        <p>American Futures. The Market this week has been fairly active with
                            frequent fluctuations but prices have generally had a declining
                            tendency, todays closing values being 23 ½ points lower for old Crop,
                            and 18 to 22 points lower for the New Crop positions, than those of last
                            Thursday. The decline is chiefly due to a week of fine warm weather
                            generally throughout the Cotton area, to liquidation by the "Bull"
                            interest, an to some "Bear" manipulation. It is difficult to predict the
                            course of the market; there must be a considerable long interest yet to
                            be liquidated, but there will remain for some time a great sensitiveness
                            to any unfavorable weather conditions, and it seems more than probable
                            that we shall be liable to frequent sharp fluctuations; a continuance of
                            fine warm weather might easily send prices down to 6d plb. or on the
                            other hand any recurrence of unfavorable conditions would certainly
                            cause renewed speculation, and a quick advance. </p>

                    <head>SUEZ CANAL COMPANY</head>
                    <p>The following is an abstract of the report presented at the annual meeting
                        held in Paris on June 4th :—</p>
                    <p>The traffic on the Canal, which diminished slightly in 1905, showed
                        improvement in 1906, and slightly exceeded that of 1904, hitherto the record
                        year. Thus, although the rate reduction which came into effect on January 1,
                        1906, involved a diminution in receipts of nearly 10 million francs, the
                        actual decline is less than 6 millions, owing to the expansion in the
                        traffic.</p>
                    <p>The cautious appropriations approved by the shareholders for 1904 and 1905
                        would have enabled us to face a less favourable position, and we have no
                        hesitation in proposing to fix the dividend for 1906 at 141 francs net the
                        same rate as for the two preceding years, while at the same time making
                        large provision for statutory reserve and for amortisation funds.</p>
                    <p>The total receipts in 1906 amounted to 111,989,123francs, ora decline, as
                        compared with 1905, of 5,319,074 francs. The loss on transit dues, amounting
                        to 5,868,136 francs, has been reduced by about 550,000 francs owing to an
                        increase in the subsidiary receipts of the Company. The total expanses
                        amounted to 42,279,469 francs, including 4,000,000 franos for depreciation
                        and 150,321 francs for insurance funds. This is an increase of 1,295,285
                        francs as compared with 1905, the greater part of which is due to
                        expenditure on the maintenance of the Canal. The balance of receipts over
                        expenditure is 69,709,653 francs—a decline of 6,614,359 francs as compared
                        with 1905. Of this amount 3 per cent., or 2,091,290 francs, is set aside for
                        statutory reserve, leaving a balance of 67,618,364 francs, to which must be
                        added 15,673 francs brought forward, leaving a disposable total of
                        67,634,037 francs. In order to maintain t|ie net dividend of 141 francs it
                        is proposed to withdraw 3,800,000 francs from the special reserve
                        accumulated during the two previous years, raising the total amount
                        available to 71,434,037 francs. Of this the dividend will absorb 71,377,465
                        francs, leaving 56,572 francs to be carried forward. It will be noticed that
                        the appropriation from special reserve leaves intact more than half of that
                        fund, and that the statutory reserve has been increased, part of which will
                        ultimately be available for dividend purposes. Hence the position is such as
                        to assure the continuance of the present rate of distribution.</p>
                    <p>During the year 1906 there passed through the Canal 3,975 vessels,
                        representing a tonnage of 13,445,504 tons. As compared with 1905, this is a
                        diminution of 141 vessels and an increase of 811,399 tons. The development,
                        of the traffic in 1906 is, therefore, due exclusively to an increase in the
                        average tonnage per vessel, which was particularly marked last year, the
                        average tonnage rising from 3,191 tons in 1905 to 3,382 tons in 1906. An
                        important modification has recently been introduced into the regulations
                        with regard to the transit of tank petroleum steamers, which, though it did
                        not come into eft’eot in 1906, ought to be mentioned. When the transit of
                        such vessels was authorised in 1891 the Company confined the permission to
                        the transport of refined pe troleum, and excluded raw petroleum and
                        essences. Owing to the great importance which the development of tho
                        motor-car industry has given to essenoes, and of their shipment in large
                        quantities from the Dutch East Indies to Europe via the Cape of Good Hope,
                        it has been found impossible to restrict them from passing through the
                        Canal, and their transit will tie permitted in future, subject to such
                        conditions as will avoid dangerous risks.</p>
                    <p>Both the Port Said and the Maritime Canals have been maintained in good
                        navigable condi tion by dredging. A depth of 10.50 metres has been kept up,
                        and at the end of 1906 there were only a few spots where the depth was as
                        little as 9.50 meties. As after the execution of the works projected this
                        year the former figure will be attained or exceeded throughout the entire
                        length of the Canal, it has been decided to extend the maximum draught of
                        vessels to 8.53 metres (28 feet English), the present maximum being 8.23
                        metres (27 feet English).</p>
                    <p>A third dredge has been ordered, of the same type as that supplied in 1905,
                        which will be one of the most important in existence.</p>
                    <p>Improvements were actively oarried on in 1906, including the construction of
                        new basins on the Asian bank for petroleum and coal vessels, the enlargement
                        of the Cherif basin, the reconstruction and lengthening of the East jetty
                        and the creation of new basins for the general works. Other new schemes of
                        importance will be begun shortly, which must necessarily take several years,
                        but which will be completed as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>As stated in the last report, the repatriation of Russian troops from
                        Manchuria contributed to an appreciable extent to swell the receipts during
                        the earlier months of 1906. There were employed on this service 71
                        vessels,with a tonnage of about 267,000 tons, which car ried more than
                        120,000 men. After this spe- uial transit was over traffic fell to a more
                        normal level, but it was continuously active during the remainder of the
                        year. The Indian harvest of 1905-06 led to the expectation that the exports
                        would lead to an import trade of magnitude. This anticipation wits not
                        realised, but there was great expansion in tho growth of shipmentsfrora
                        Europe to the regions beyond Suez, thus affording further proof of the
                        diversify of your traffics, and the way in which loss in one direction is
                        counterbalanced gain in another. The great extension recently of postal
                        navigation, and of regular servioes cargo-boats, also contributed largely to
                        successful results of last year, results which have even been improved upon
                        in 1907. Many ships have passed through the Canal from north to south in
                        search of freight at Asiatic ports, and their return, which is not yet over
                        has helped to keep things active. Generally king, the situation may be
                        regarded as satisfactory.</p>
                    <p>The directors greatly regret the loss last January of their colleague, M.
                        Julien Lefebvre, who joined the Council in 1888, and had not ceased, in
                        spite of his great age, to work assiduously on behalf of the Company. More
                        recently the death of M. Casimir-Perier has bad to be deplored. As member
                        and as Vice- President of the Council he gave the Company the benefit of his
                        great experience and of his eminent authority. We have appointed M. Denis
                        Peron.se, formerly inspector general of bridges and roads, and member of the
                        Works Consultative Committee since 1893, to succeed M. Lefebvre, and M.
                        Lépjne in place ofM. Casimir Perier. We ask yon to confirm these
                        nominations, and to roelect the fonr retiring directors, MM. R. Guichard and
                        C. Jonnart, ice-Admiral Humann, and Lord Rothmore. Appended to the full

                    <p>All over the worldyou meet the Englishman, and wherever you find him, he
                        seems always to be engaged, like some flagellant monk, in inflicting pain
                        upon himself. You meet him, says the "County Gentleman," half-fainting under
                        the tropical sun in Africa forests plagued by flies, tormented by thirst,
                        needlessly running the risk of attack by wild beasts; or you may see him
                        tossed on the furious seas in his yacht, his lips cracked with salt, his
                        eyes half-blinded by driving rain. On almost inaccessible mountains, on
                        ice-floes, on burning deserts, it is always the same. Wherever you meet the
                        mad Englishmanhe is in difficulties or looking for them ; and he looks at
                        you from under his sun-helmet, or out of his furs and remarks, with an inane
                        grin: "isnt it rippin?" Such he is abroad; and behold, when you seek him in
                        his home, expecting to see him at least fairly rational there, you probably
                        find him floundering in the early hours of the morning in a six-foot tank of
                        cold water.</p>

                    <p>SHEIKH KIDWAI'S SPEECH</p>
                    <p>Sir Charles Elliott presided at the farewell dinner given on Tuesday week, at
                        the Carlton Hotel, to Sheikh Mushir Hossain Kidwai, hon. secretary of the
                        Pan-Islamic Society, on the occasion of his return to India. Dr. B. Wahby
                        (Egypt) was among those present.</p>
                    <p>The toast of “Shaikh Mushir Hossain Kidwai of Gadia” was proposed by Mr. A.
                        Billal Quilliam, on behalf of the society, and by the Divan Badri Nath, on
                        behalf of friends.</p>
                    <p>Sheikh M. H. Kidwai, in reply, said that he should always have the happiest
                        recollections of that gathering, which seemed to be rather a religious
                        conference than a farewell dinner. Every great religion of the world was
                        represented at the tables. There were people of different colours and
                        races—from Turkey, Persia, Egypt, South Africa, Portuguese India, and India.
                        It was this kind of common fraternity that Pan- Islamists wanted to
                        establish all over the world. Sir Auckland Colvin recently wrote ta him that
                        religion in its essence was “disruptive and alienistic but he was a Musulman
                        because he believed that Islam’s greatest object was to establish a
                        universal brotherhood withont any distinction of colour, or race, or
                        position, or sex, or age, or country, and he had become a Pan-Islamist
                        because he believed that the spread of these essential Islamic principles
                        would remove the most unhappy, disruptive, and alienistic tendencies of the
                        modern age—the race, colour, and country prejudices. This society was
                        disruptive in no way. It had been his constant desire that the English
                        people should have friendly relations with the Muslims, and that England
                        should be a kind of guide towards the way to progress on modem lines for the
                        Muslim dominions. He had been trying not only to remove the prejudices of
                        the Christian people towards the Musulmans, but also to unite Jews with
                        Muslims, and he went so far as an urge that, in India, Musulmans should not
                        by any means let their friendly relations with Hindus be disturbed even
                        though they suffered political loss. They called themselves Pan-Islamists,
                        not because they aimed at any political aggrandisement or territorial
                        expansion of Islam, but because they wanted to spread the Islamic principles
                        and because they wanted to regenerate Musulmails. He wished to impress on
                        the minds of his co-religionists of Egypt and also upon his Hindu brethren
                        in India, that the future prosperity of a nation did not depend so much upon
                        territorial possessions or political achievements, as upon industrial and
                        commercial advancement. The Musulmans of the world and the Hindus of India
                        must realize fully the fact, that their regeneration was impossible unless
                        they and their countries progressed economically and financially in commerce
                        and industry. It was not only Muslins who failed to realize the importance
                        of this point. Even English statesmen did not pay due attention to it.
                        Germany had realized it, and had abstained from going into de niQifstrations
                        against Turkey. She had encouraged Morocco, and, in fact, saved that country
                        from the hands of France. Why ? Only to win the good will of the people of
                        those countries, and thus make them her good customers. We should lose India
                        commercially if we exasperated the people of that country. The sWord could
                        not in these days secure customers; good customers should be conciliated and
                        humoured, not insulted as in South Africa, or irritated as in India, Turkey,
                        and Morocco. In conclusion, he expressed the hope that he might come back to
                        England to further the Mosque and the Anglo-Muslim friendship club schemes.
                        (Cheers.)</p>

                    <head>ELECTRICITY IN TURKEY</head>
                    <p> The British Chamber of Commerce of Turkey's forwarded to the Manchester
                        Chamber of Commerce a statement regarding the probable extension in the near
                        future of the electrical industry in the Ottoman Empire.</p>
                    <p>English contractors should, it is pointed out, take steps to place themselves
                        in a position to tender when necessary. The number of electrical
                        installations in Turkey is steadily in creasing, and the Government
                        contemplate electrically lighting the capital and other cities and also
                        undertaking the supply of power for the tramways. It is suggested that
                        contractors and electrical firms in Great Britain should appoint agents in
                        Constantinople and be prepared to send experts to Turkey whenever necessary
                        This is the practice of German and Belgian electricians, and the former have
                        hitherto obtained most of the contracts for the electrical undertakings. If
                        British contractors will take the same steps they should be able to secure
                        fair amount of business. It is reported that there is at present some
                        disposition on the part of the Ottoman Government to favour British
                        enterprises.</p>
                    <p>The secretary for the North of England of the British Chamber (Mr. George
                        Thomas), who makes the communication, will be pleased to obtain any further
                        information which may be desired by firms interested.</p>
