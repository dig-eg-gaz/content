                    <head>A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.</head>
                    <p>We announced in our columns some weeks ago, the arrival in Alexandria of Mr.
                        W. A. Coote, the secretary of the National Vigilance Association, who had
                        come to Egypt in con</p>
                    <p>nection with the suppression of what generally known as the "white slave traf
                        Mr. Coots has now gone home again, ha in the meantime succeeded far beyond
                        anticipations in setting on foot a strong m ment, not only for the
                        realisation of the object of his visit, but for the equally portant
                        establishment of a Rescue Hom which not only can the girls be placed are
                        rescued from the clutches af "souteneu but others will be furnished with a
                        mean escape from the position in which they themselves, either from choice
                        or compulsion, placed. Many people are inclined to doubt the existence of
                        any such traffic as that alleged to exist. But surely the speech made by Mr.
                        Coote at the French Consulate, and reported in our columns, would dispel any
                        scepticism on that point, while if further proof were needed we have only to
                        mention that on the arrival of a Black Sea steamer a few days ago an
                        instance of this form of traffic was found. The facts were immediately
                        placed before the Russian Consul, who took away the man's passport for the
                        time being and had the girl removed to a place of safety.</p>
                    <p>The ground had been to some extent prepared by the visit last year of Mr.
                        Claude Montefiore of London, who urged upon the Jewish community here the
                        necessity for action, seeing that so many of the girls were Jews, but principally by the untiring exertions of the Rev. P. Rudolph, who for many years
                        has done his utmost-singlehanded, we may almost say, although his work has
                        always had the hearty co-operation of the police authorities, especially of
                        Major Hopkinson, who has long been fully aware of the existing evil. The
                        great difficulty in the way of effective action, as no one will be surprised
                        to learn, has been in the facilities given by the Capitulations for the
                        successful evasion of laws and regulations, and consular supineness, if
                        nothing further, has helped this great stumbling block in the way of reform,
                        to thwart the efforts of those, trying to circumvent the wily scoundrels who
                        have taken full advantage of the exceptional state of the law in this
                        country. Before leaving our shores, Mr. Coote had the satisfaction not only
                        of enlisting the active aid of the entire consular body, who are well
                        represented on the strong committee that has been formed, but of knowing
                        that the Jewish community, with Baron Jacques de Menasce at their head, have
                        decided to present to the committee a large house with extensive grounds at
                        Rue de Nil, Karmous, for a home for girls. We understand that the house is
                        in every respect fitted for the purpose, one great recommendation being its
                        distance from the crowded parts of the town, which makes it less accessible
                        to undesirable visitors. A committee of ladies is to be formed forthwith to
                        act in concert with the executive committee now in course of formation. It
                        is intended also to form committees at Port Said and Cairo to act in
                        conjunction with the central committee here.</p>
                    <p>The Capitulations are an intolerable hindrance to this work. For example,
                        representstions have lately been made to Lord Cromer as to the state of
                        affairs in a notorious district of Cairo. But what can he do as things are
                        now to bring about a cleansing not only of this plague-spot, but of many
                        other haunts of vice, with his hands tied ? Lord Milner in 1893 denounced
                        the Capitulations, and devoted a chapter of "England in Egypt" to show the
                        abuses that result from these "International Fetters," but here in 1905,
                        after a lapse of another 12 years, they are. in full force and restricting
                        the work of the regeneration of Egypt as greatly as ever. The movement that
                        has taken place during the last few weeks-which, we omitted to mention, has
                        Lord Cromer's hearty support and best wishesis a step in the right
                        direction, and we welcome it as an earnest of much to follow towards
                        bringing about that righteousness which exalteth a nation.</p>

                    <p>THE WORK OF THE BRANCHES.</p>
                    <p>In dealing with the branch societies, Mr Rumbold states that in addition to
                        the affilia ted branches working at Zagazig, Luxor, Man sourah, and Assouan,
                        new branches were founded in 1904 at Assiout and Tantah. Dele gates from the
                        first four societies came to Caird and were supplied with forms and books,
                        being likewise taught the work. At present the Moudiriehs of Menoufieh,
                        Behera (Alexandria, of course, excepted), Keneh, Girgeh, Beni Souef, and
                        inieh are without branches, but it is hoped that this want will be filled in
                        the near future.</p>
                    <p>Dealing with the work of the branches, the writer takes Luxor first, and his
                        remarks on the state of affairs deserve to be quoted in full :-</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Howard Carter, who had managed the Luxor branch of the S.P.C.A. since
                        its foundation, was obliged to hand over his duties to Mr. Western, of the
                        Railway Administration, in consequence of his transfer to Cairo in 1904. Mr.
                        Carter took great interest in this branch, and despite the numerous calls on
                        his time, was largely responsible for the efficiency to which it has
                        attained."</p>
                    <p>Donations to the amount of L.E. 30 were made to the Luxor branch during the
                        past year, but Mr. Western in the letter covering his report, says, "As
                        regards the support that the winter visitors give us, my experience is very
                        short but, such as it is, it does not appear that they are willing to give
                        anything. I hope this state of things will improve. In view of the fact that
                        the prosperity of this branch of the society qay be said to be almost
                        entirely dependent on the support extended to it by visitors, in whose
                        interests it exclusively works, it is greatly to be hoped that contributions
                        from this source will be freely forthcoming,</p>
                    <p>During the past year 194 animals were admitted into the Luxor infirmary and
                        187 discharged as cured.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dundas Edwards, in forwarding his annual statement on the Assouan branch
                        of the S.P.C.A, says: "It will be seen that this branch is in a very
                        satisfactory financial condition. The visitors subscribe liberally and the
                        local police authorities afford us every assistance. The actual number of
                        animals treated in the infirmary must not be taken to be the extent of the
                        work done. The knowledge of the existence of the society has a strong
                        deterrent effect, and animals working in an unfit condition and acts of
                        cruelty are far more rarely seen here. . . . The three drinking troughs
                        towards which the Cairo S.P.C.A. gave us a special grant last year are in
                        constant demand. 167 animals passed through the Assouan infirmary during the
                        past year."</p>

                    <p>The hon. treasurer of Victoria College (Mr. H. P. Kingham), in submitting the

                        second scholastic year terminating 30th September, 1904, says that, in

                        has been met out of the ordinary receipts, so that the college may now be
                        considered to be paying its way. The extraordinary expenditure has, however,
                        exceeded the estimates prepared last year, both during the period under
                        review and subsequent thereto.</p>
                    <p>No further extraordinary expenditure is in contemplation so long as the
                        college remains where it is at present situated, and if its present property
                        be sold at any price approaching that which the committee hope will be rea

                    <p>After a careful perusal of Mr. J. E. Snelus' report on the Um Rus Gold Mines
                        of Egypt, we should think (says the "Financier") there can be no question as
                        to the advisability of the proposal therein set forth to raise more capital.
                        In view of the satisfactory progress achieved by the company up to the
                        present time, the directors are of opinion that the scale of operations
                        should be extended, with the ultimate objects of increasing the number of
                        stamps and erecting a cyanide plant for the recovery of the gold from the
                        tailings. It is, therefore, proposed to increase the capital to £180,000, by
                        the creation of 30,000 shares of £1, to be issued at par to holders in the
                        proportion of one new for every five old shares held. It must be remembered
                        that the company is on the verge of the crushing stage, Mr. Alford himself
                        being in charge. In fact, the development work thus far accomplished once
                        more emphasises the old proverb that it would be a pity to spoil the ship
                        for the sake of a ha'porth of tar. Thus argued the market to-day after the
                        circulation of the report, when was manifest a strong partiality for the
                        shares.</p>

                    <dateline>London, March 16.</dateline>
                    <p>The British army in Egypt is to consist of the following troops in 1905-06
                        :-Squadron of Mounted and Military Police, 121; one com pany Royal Garrison
                        Artillery, 151; one company Royal Engineers, 110; three battalions 5 of
                        Infantry, 2,586; Army Service Corps, 97; Royal Army Medical Corps, 127;
                        other departmental corps, 51-total 3,243, or 2,360 of all ranks less than
                        last year. This reduction has been effected by the withdrawal of one cavalry
                        regiment, two batteries of artillery, one battalion of infantry, and one
                        company Royal Malta Artillery.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Arnold Forster, in his memorandum, states that "at the request of the
                        British Representative in Egypt the Government of Egypt has agreed to
                        increase its contribution towards the cost of the British force in that
                        country from £87,000 to £100,000 annually."</p>
                    <p>There is a good story about General Slade's predecessor as G.O.C. in Egypt in
                        Vicomte Robert d'Humières new work "Through Isle and Empire." Before Sir
                        Reginald Talbot came to Egypt he was military attaché in Paris, where he had
                        some trouble in obtaining his election to "Le Jockey," "because of his an-
                        cestor's differences with Joan of Arc. It was Baron Alphonse who started
                        this hare: the others had forgotten all about it." The member of the well
                        informed race naturally knew French history, and the non-Jew French mem-
                        bers of the fashionable club naturally did not.</p>
                    <p>Major C. L. E. Robertson-Eustace, D.S.O., King's Royal Rifle Corps, has been
                        ordered to join the 1st Battalion at Cairo at an early date, on vacating the
                        adjutancy of the 8th Battalion at Carlow. Major Robertson-Eustace served in
                        the Manipore Expedition 1891, (medal with clasp), Chin Hills operation's
                        (clasp), South African operations 1896, in which he was severely wounded
                        (medal), and in the Boer War 1899, 1900, and 1902 with the Mounted Infantry,
                        including, the fighting on the road to Ladysmith (mentioned in despatches,
                        D.S.O., medal with five clasps, King's medal with two clasps).</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant D. S. B. Thomson, R.A.M.C., Dublin, has been selected for service
                        with the Egyptian Army and ordered to join directly. He has been fifteen
                        months in the medical service.</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. "Renown" has been finally chosen to convey T.R.H. the Prince and
                        Princess of Wales from England to Bombay on the occasion of their Indian
                        visit. The battleship has had very satisfactory steam trials.</p>
                    <p>The decision of the Government to keep a strong naval force in Far Eastern
                        waters during the terrible struggle there 'meets with the approval of
                        everyone, even those who are the strongest apologists for retrenchment in
                        naval and military expenditure. Indeed the triumph of the "blue-water"
                        school is so complete and, the redistribution of our over-sea forces so
                        distinctly advantageous from an Imperial point of view, that it bids fair to
                        rule unchallenged for many years to come-thanks to able, silent "Jacky
                        Fisher," who 'performs where others talked.</p>

                    <head>NILE VALLEY BLOCK "E."</head>
                    <p>The report of the directors of the Nile Valley Block "E," Limited, states
                        that the balance- sheet shows a balance in hand of £4,888. The amount spent
                        upon the work of the company at Block "E" is £3,508; upon the Dongola
                        concession, £3,525; management expenses in London, £1,921, from which it
                        will be gathered that the most rigid economy has been practised in the
                        development and prospecting of the property. The properties now owned are:-
                        -The Nile Valley Block "E"; the Dongola concession. The directors have been
                        so much encouraged by the results of the work in the "8a" shaft of the Block
                        "E" that they have applied to the Egyptian Government for a mining lease for
                        30 years, renewable for 15 years. The flotation of the Dongola concession
                        has been engaging the earnest attention of the directors, who expect shortly
                        to be able to announce that, an arrangement has been arrived at whereby the
                        successful flotation has been assured on very favorable terms to Block "E,"
                        Limited, as the vendor company. With a view to obtaining the necessary funds
                        for the thorough and systematic development of the mine on Block "E," the
                        directors, after mature deliberation, have decided to recommend the
                        shareholders to authorise the increase of the capital to £50,000 by the
                        issue of 20,000 new shares, of £1 each, and they propose to offer 6,000
                        shares, as near as may be, to the shareholders as "rights," in the
                        proportion of one new share to every five shares of the original capital
                        standing in shareholders' names in the register on the 31st inst. The
                        subscription has been guaranteed on the terms that the guarantors are to
                        have allotted to them at par any of the shares so offered which may not be
                        accepted by the shareholders. The guarantors are also to have the right to
                        subscribe at par any time within six calendar months from the date of the
                        offer for 2,500 shares, and the further right to subscribe for an additional
                        2,500 shares at any time within nine calendar months from the date of the
                        offer, at £1 5s. per share. The balance of the shares to be issued by the
                        directors when and on such terms as they may deem advisable.</p>

                        <dateline>Fayoum, March 21, </dateline>
                        <p>Although I greatly appreciate what the writer of "Under the Mosquito Net"
                            says in the "Gazette" generally, I must contradict him on one point, and
                            I can never agree with his correspondent that the American missionaries
                            in Egypt "do a lot of harm." All the educated Copts you meet in this
                            country have graduated in the American schools and colleges. The
                            American missionaries have been working here for more than half a
                            century, and never were the cause of any trouble or dispute with the
                            Mohamedans or Copts. They have no political or other outside interest in
                            their work, which they do patiently and peacefully. If it were not for
                            the American Mission the English in 1882 would not have found any native
                            in this country to translate for them the Arabic language; the American
                            native graduates were of much help at the time.</p>
                        <p>The knowledge of hygienic laws necessary to ensure a future civilised
                            Egyptian nation can be obtained only through the education of Egyptian
                            girls. This the American Mission fully realise, as they have one or two
                            girls' schools in every province, superintended by an American lady with
                            Syrian teachers. The American missionaries have done and are doing a
                            great deal of good in this country.</p>
                        <p>As to intoxicating liquors, I believe it is the Europeans who are pushing
                            the trade into the country. Europeans are teaching the natives to drink,
                            and this is well known to the English inspectors, for when they travel
                            in the country they find many Europeans keeping liquor stores in
                            villages. I believe that Europeans who keep liquor shops in provinces
                            are under the protection of the authorities, and it is they who are
                            responsible for the fact that the ignorant fellaheen, who were innocent
                            of the habit before, have now acquired the craze for drinking
                            intoxicants. The peasant does not as yet understand that liquors are
                            injurious to him.</p>

                        chiefs of the Government departments, the consular agents, and the notables.
                        Great regret was expressed by many speakers at the loss the province had
                        sustained by the removal of the guest to another sphere of duty. Mr.
