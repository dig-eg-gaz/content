                    <head>A Light Nourishment for General Use.</head>
                    <head>Allenburys' DIET</head>
                    <p>The "Allenburys" DIET is a complete milk and farinaceous Food, easy of
                        assimilation, most agreeable to take, simply and quickly made. It is
                        recommended in place of ordinary milk foods, gruel, etc., and whilst
                        acceptable to all as a light nourishment, it is particularly helpful to
                        Dyspeptics, Invalids and the Aged. In the sick-room it will be found
                        invaluable and it is easily and quickly made, the addition of boiling water
                        only being necessary. </p>
                    <p>The "Allenburys" DIET is readily digested by tose who are unable to take
                        cow's milk and is particularly serviceable in convalescence. When taken as a
                        light supper diet it will be found to promote tranquil and refreshing sleep.
                        Although this DIET is a good for ADULTS and is entirely distinct fom the
                        "Allenburys" Foods for Infants, yet it is also of great value as a
                        restorative food for young children, especially during convalescence. </p>
                    <p>For Invalids, Dyspeptics &amp; The aged.</p>

                        <p>If the Present Government succeed in living out any ng the allotted span
                            of Ministérial “existence, says the “Pall Mall Gazette”, they ought to
                            succeed in Jeaving behind them a remarkable collection of what “Mr.
                            Panch” thas described as “things one would rather not have said.” The
                            pidus founder.and most gen8rous benefactor of that Maseum ‘is,’ ot
                            course, the Prime Minister, ‘Time was when the “blazing indiscretions”
                            of thelate Lord Salisbury used occasionally 1» astonish both his friends
                            and his foes. But Lord Salisbury was always wise, and often witty ; and,
                            if he was. somewhat given - to thinking. aloud, he never spoke without
                            ‘thinking. Not so our own good Sir Henry. “Methods of barbarism” and
                            “sqvalid bonds” are fair specimens of the sort of thing which his
                            supporters periodically find themselves © compelled to explain away, as

                            to do yesterday, and the day before, i. the Lords with regard to the
                            “very satisfietory” state of Ireland.. And; as with the Premier, so with
                            other members of the Government-and party. Now there is some delicate
                            personal allusion, or pies? more picturesque than polite phraseology by
                            the Under-Secretary for the Colonies : anon we have Mr. Birrell and his
                            “carrion crows.” Yesterday it was the torn of Lord Denman, who, in an
                            evil hour, had been put up to answer Lord. Londonderry, and thought
                            proper to excise the offence of cattle-driving as not being in the eyes
                            of the Govérnment, “a crime of a very serious natare.” We yenture to say
                            that this is a specimen well worthy of a glass all to itselfin the
                            Memorial Museam of the Ministry of Allthe Mistakes. It is quite the most
                            mischievous—and gratuitously mis- chievous—thing said by Minister, or on
                            the Ministerial behalf, since "methods of bar- barism,” becduse, like
                            that classic phrase, it will encourage the foeg. and discourage the
                            friends, of England, the of whom, in this case, are not the Boers, but
                            the’ disloyal and lawless lrishry. By this time, as we do not doubt,
                            every newspaper in ile Nationalist and.Unionist, is spreading far and.
                            wide the news that the Government do not consider the action which is
                            making’ life intolerable . on nearly two hundred and fifty grazing farms
                            to be “a crime of a very serious natare.” Well, everything is relative ;
                            is not murder, ‘or arson, or “cat ‘iming—though it may well lead ee
                            three. But it is a form of intimi tely planned for the ruin of two whole
                            pe of the King’s subjects, the landlords who have lawfully let their
                            land, and the graziers who have lawfully taken it. ‘To say that
                            organized and violent interference with the rights of these men is not a
                            crime of serious nature is the negation of law{and order—it is nothihg
                            less than the justification of anarchy.</p>
                        <p>It goes, of course, without saying that the Government had-to explain
                            away Lord Den- man : no amount of tenderness for the cattle- drivers
                            could blind either Lord Crewe or Lord Ripon to the necessity of
                            declaring that Min- igters were firmly determined to put down disorder.
                            The law, said Lord Ripon, will be ined without fear or favour. We hope
                            it will ; but, so far, it has not been sufficiently efficacious to
                            prevent, Lord Lansdowne stated, the surrender of thirty farms in
                            Roscommon within the past few weeks. There is, however, an aspect of the
                            Irish situation which law- abiding often fail to appreciate, simply
                            because it is quite alien to any personal experience of their own. It
                            may be confidently asserted that the real measurs of the terrorisu:
                            exercised by the United Irish League, like that of the Camorra in
                            Southern Italy, is not tobe ascertained from the statistics of outrages
                            actually committed. When a policy of terrorism has been entered upon,
                            and when the beliet is general, alike among the terrorists atid their
                            victims, . that!the Irish Government is not dis- posed to deal severely
                            with offenders, the need for what the Frencly revolutionaries call “'ac-
                            tion directe” is very considerably diminished. When the prospective
                            victims of agrarian Outrage are well aware that prosecutions are bound
                            to fail, that magistrates will not sum- marily convict, and that it is
                            hopeless to expect justice at the hands of local juries what i4 open to
                            them except surrender! That we have not the slightest doubt, is the true
                            inwardness of the comparative tranquil- ie of. fitietaiots in which it
                            is notorions that the League is omnipotent, History is, in fact,
                            repeating itselfin Ireland, with no perceptible variation, at the*
                            present time.” The United Trish League is playing the game of the old
                            Land -League, its own true begetter, in pre- cisely the Land League's
                            old way. And, as might be expected, it is not on that side alone that
                            the historical parallel is being drawn with geometrical accuracy. The
                            present Liberal Government is merely giving the old answers to the old.
                            questions, and with the old results. Things are, in consequence, going
                            from bad to worse, as they went a generation ago, and the time is
                            rapidly coming when even Mi Birrell will be compelled to make up his
                            mind whether Ireland is to"be ruled by the King’s ‘Government or by.
                            that of the United Irish League. That, assuredly, is the way events are
                            trending, back through the old course of crime to the inevitable
                            dilemma—the law of the League? Which is it going to be?</p>

                            several bottles of beer, commenced to fight each other with them. Upon
                            the interference of the police their attention was directed towards

                    <p>Referring to: our special cable of the.8th inst. “Al Watan” says :—</p>
                    <p>Our last article on this subject- has been quoted and diseussed by the
                        Eurepean Press, Unfortunately the discussion was in the wrong direction
                        owing to a mistake of the London paper which published a precis of our
                        article wired by its Caifo correspondent. In that precis “I'he Globe” told
                        therworld that we had applied for a British Protectorate thus neces-
                        sitating enquiry into the source and effect of our quoted article and a
                        subsequent outburst of heat and anger in the local National Press with its
                        concomitants of misrepresentation and abuse. “Al Minbar” and other
                        misinformed’ papers were full yesterday of deprecations and insmuations
                        before waiting to ascertain the facts.. We have nothing new to say on the
                        subject of the Veiled Protectorate beyond the fact that an error in
                        transmission has led to a misunderstanding of our. views. In the article
                        which gave rise to this discussion we repeatedly and plainly said that we do
                        not apply for annexation or open protection, that we do not invite England
                        to swallow our inde- pendence, and that we prefer a native Govern- ment,
                        hoping that England will help us to gain our independence one day. All we
                        desired and prayed for was a shift from the untenable position of temporary
                        occupation which has been held too long, anend to the uncertainty of this
                        unofficial and undecided form of Govern- ment which helps in creating
                        trouble and gives a wide scope for seditious agitation. We explained that
                        under the present circumstan- ces England had no right to remain in’ Egypt,
                        that she“is here in the timid and hesitating manner of the guest who has
                        overstayed his welcone. Unless the Veiled Protectorate was put ona more
                        permanent footing, agitation will go on and the work of Government will
                        become dangerous or perhaps impossible. This was the essence of ovr wrongly
                        quoted article which had Mr. Dicey’s interview with the Khedive for its
                        raison d’étre. In that interview his Highness gave expression to his views
                        on'the Occupation and Protectorate ard opened the door-for public comments
                        on the subject. We are sorry. that an erroneous transmission of our views
                        has caused a misunderstanding, but we were not astonished at the venom of
                        the Na- tionalist Press in Cairo, unprovoked and un- justified.</p>

                    <head>A NEW WORK UPON ANCIENT EGYPTIAN RELIGION.</head>
                    <p>By Joseph Offord.</p>
                    <p>The first series of lectures delivered at the College of France, in Paris,
                        upon thé founda- tion bequeathed, for the purpose by M. Micho- uis, was by
                        M. Edward Naville, the well known Swiss Egyptologist, and director now for
                        some years of the exploration at Deir-el-Bahari. It is fortunate for science
                        that the opportunity of this course of lectures induced Mr. - Naville to set
                        forth what ‘his knowledge enable to tell of the religion of the ancient
                        Egyptians. It is now nearly 30 years ‘since he published a'translation of
                        the “Sdlar Litany” and of the ‘Myth of Horns,” and he is the greatest living
                        authority npon the “Book for the Dead” and all he has to say about Egyptian
                        culture, worship and theology in the excellent little volumn pablished as
                        part of theAnnals of the Musée Giumet,” by M. Ernest Leroux of Paris will be
                        carefully studied.</p>
                    <p>M. Naville explains, in the preface that in the lectures /he has treated of
                        the six most Important matters, whose developement ‘get forth the chief
                        aspects of Egyptian religion, becautse the field is so vast, no complete
                        study could be made in six addresses, or comprvesetl into 270 pages.</p>
                    <p>The first chapter is devoted to a diego of the origin of the ancient
                        Egyptians, and tHe probability of the earlier civilisation they acquired
                        being derived from Babylonia ; and the author sums-up his view on the first
                        part of the subject by giving-it as -his opinion that the original
                        popnlation, so far as any vestige of mankind” enabl@.us to come to a was of
                        African origin and was ci ed by Asiatic invaders coming from Arabia, who had
                        crossed the Red Sea and entered Nubia to the south.</p>
                    <p>By “African” as the type of the earliest Egyptian race known to us, M.
                        Naville does not mean Negroid, but a white race now represented by the
                        Berbers and Kabyles, and in late Egyptian times shown apon the monu- ments
                        as tribes to the west of the Nile Valley, ealled Temenhon or Tehennoy. Thése
                        the author connects with the old Anon, or Archer people, with whom fhe Horus
                        invaders of the country, whose cliief emblem was: (or whose greatest tribe —
                        for emblem) a falcon fought and conquered. As to whether the Anon Were
                        sufficiently civilised ‘to reside ‘in cities Me Naville is uncertain, but
                        points ont that Aii, the earliest name*for Heliopolis, is. the, first half
                        of their namé and that it was at that point that’ the conqueror’s first
                        established any metropolitan religious centre, probably-an old Anou
                        town,</p>
                    <p>That the conquerors who: introduced the arts and culturé to the first

                    <p>With reference to the Babylonian origin of Egyptian: civilisation M. Naville
                        says * “I do “not believe that. Bgypt is a daughter ot “Babylon, ‘but on the
                        other hand we can quite “admit-they are both connected with Arabia; “it -was

                        two”.</p>
                    <p>Wi d_ respect for the erudition of. Mr. Naville, this does not explain the
                        striking fact that the Mene’s.dynasty introduced into Egypt the use of the
                        Babylonian cylinder as a signet, 4(form not}Arabian or very suitable for the
                        Nilotie'people!whose documents were upon stone, leather or papyris, and
                        except for the jar sealings and so called funeral cones not of clay.</p>
                    <p>‘The use of these cones is also absolutely identical with the practice, at
                        'Telloh and else where near tothe Persian Gulf. Moreover an extremely
                        ancient drawing upon a small relic discoyered by Mr.de Morgan at Tejloh
                        shows @ boat, or sacred barque, with similar Totem poles, supporting, a
                        Caput bovis, to those of carly Egyptian pottery.</p>
                    <p>There is also a probability that these divine emblems are alluded to in old
                        cuneiform texts as being placed at the entrance, to Mes mian temples ; just
                        as they are shown in front of the primitive temple pylons, upon the drawings
                        of the divine processional barques described. by Mr. Foncart.</p>
                    <p>M. Alfred Boissier in his “Pextes Rélatifs a la Divination
                        Assyro-Babylousene,” refers to a word “Surinnu” which Mr. Thureau Dargin has
                        praved means emblem, guidown, rallying post, or flagstaff: Dr. Lehmann has
                        shown that these poles, or pillars were erected in front of temples. The
                        very old inscriptions of king Gudea of Telloh, in Maritime Babylonia speak
                        of them. Some of them “shone like the. light” and were coated with gold or
                        silyer. In the old Cuneiform /Astrologicrl, or augural, reports, a portent
                        of dire disaster was the destruction of these Surirmu. Mr. Boissier renders
                        the word by “emblem,” perhaps: Totem would he quite as precise.</p>
                    <p>M. Calice has pointed out that the old Egyptian ‘word’ ‘‘nemset” for'a
                        certain class of vase, is the “namsa” of the ‘I'el-el-Amarna ta- blets
                        andjgoes back to the old Babylonian “namzitu.”</p>
                    <p>M. Henzly has shown an identical peouliarity of ornamentation in one of the
                        Egyptian pre- historic slatepalettes anda Babylonian cylinder engraving,
                        consisting of elongating the heads of animals. We must wait until
                        excavations upon the littoral of the Persian Gulf and at | the island of
                        Bahrein have diselosed to us the Maritime Babylonians and Elamites and their

                        of race separated by the Arabian sea, the very regionfrom which M. Naville
                        says Egyptian culture came; and the secret of the similarities between
                        Egyptian and Babylonian culture most likely lies that way.</p>
                    <p>We are of course only speaking of Semitic, or Mésopotamian analogies upon
                        Egyptian antiquities, undoubtedly dating prior to the Hyksos kings, or even
                        the early dynasty con- nection with Syria at the Sinaitic peninsula. In
                        later times Asiatic styles would be attri- butable to intercourse via Syria
                        if found in Egypt. (3)</p>
                    <p>The second chapter discusses the different modes of Sepultnre in early times,
                        and the evidence from burial relies as to the belief in a future life. M.
                        Naville considers that the numerous tombs, or ground burials, having the
                        ‘deceased arranged with the knees drawn up to the chest, is not imitation of
                        the posi- tion of the unborn child indicative ofa new birth to come ; but
                        merely the sitting - upow the hand with knees drawn up was just. the action
                        of the hunter in his hnt returned from the chase. So his limbs were arranged
                        thus after death, only the corpse was necessarily laid upon its side.
                        Certainly many funerary statues exhibit the deceased in this attitude.
                        Another suggestion is in regard to the elabor- ate tomb, or Mastaba,
                        reliefs,hich show the person in whose honor the. sépulchré’ was ornamented
                        furnished with many servants, and much cattle, fields, and orchards, yine-
                        yards-and boats. M. Naville says that’ this does not-necessarily indicate
                        that the owner of the gravé enjoyed. such opulence and broad domains on
