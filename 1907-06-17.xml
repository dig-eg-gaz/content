                            Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else

                        <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well
                            be called <hi>Nature’s Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing
                            else to give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn,
                            heat, cold or the effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor
                            irritations due to overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh

                        <p>THE KHEDIVE AND HIS CRITICS.</p>
                        <p>A Cairo correspondent of the “Telegraph”, in a message dated the 30th.
                            ult., a summary of which was cabled by our London correspon­dent on the
                            11th. inst., writes :—</p>
                        <p>As you will have gathered from my cables, practically the sole theme of
                            discussion in the Egyptian local Press, and the factor around</p>
                        <p>which have raged (to put it even mildly), expressions of opinions,
                            conjectures, assertions, accusations, and dementis, has been the article
                            in “The Daily Telegraph" by M Edward Dicey, detailing his interview with
                            his High­ness the Khedive.</p>
                        <p>Naturally enough his Highness’s remarks as to the military occupation of
                            Egypt, to the effect that Egypt was too wealthy, and at the same time
                            too weak a country not to fall under the protection of some great
                            European Power, proved the biggest bone of contention ; journalistic
                            amenities have been indulged in as they never were before in my
                            experience of the country, and the howls of derision on the part of the
                            majority of the European journals have been met by aspersions on both
                            the Khedive and Mr. Dicey by the Nationalists.</p>
                        <p>The Khedive, although in residence in Alexandria, has not felt himself
                            constrained to modify or contradict any of Mr. Dicey’s statements, and,
                            therefore, despite the conjec­tures of the Nationalist Press, one is
                            bound to accept the interview published as being a substantially
                            veracious and certainly admirably clear version of his Highness’s
                            ideas.</p>
                        <p>There can be no logical reason for doubling that the command of the
                            Khedive to see Mr. Dicey before the latter left for home was prompted by
                            the desire to remove by means of publicity in an authoritative British
                            journal, impressions conveyed by the many false and seemingly malicious
                            reports in certain of your contemporaries. I advisedly make this
                            state­ment, although I had not the pleasure of conferring with Mr Dicey
                            in the short interval between his return from the palace and hi- almost
                            immediate departure for London.</p>
                        <p>Specific charges had been made against the Khedive by a number of London
                            newspapers. His Highness had been accused in no ambi­guous terms of
                            bribery and corruption, and there were other insinuations which he was
                            unable to nail to the counter in his exalted position as sovereign of a
                            realm by the ordi­nary process of law. What more 'reasonable, then, in
                            this peculiar position, that he should take the one course open to him,
                            i.e., .to declare positively and publicly by means of" the pen of a
                            leading journalist of the day that these obvious slanders and gross
                            inuendoes had no raison d’etre.</p>
                        <p>I suggest he did not protest too much. In my humble judgment the Khedive
                            has distinct right to repudiate by the best means at hand the
                            suggestions which ‘.during the past few months have distressed and
                            annoyed him, as they would any honest man He stood in the extraordinary
                            position that he could not afford, even against his most ardent desire,
                            to ignore any longer distinct attacks made upon his integrity, and
                            insinuations which, despite his indignant protest, remained
                            uncontradict­ed. His slightest move has been construed into sedition,
                            and his lightest word interpreted as an expression of <hi rend="bold">a
                                virnlent</hi> pan-Islamite— whatever the latter phrase may mean.</p>
                        <p>And what monumental nonsense all this is, and, moreover, what a travesty
                            of the British idea of fair play and justice </p>
                        <p>From a comparatively long experience of Egypt, and having the honour of
                            knowing his Highness the Khedive personally, I am con­vinced that he is
                            only too anxious to work in cordial co-operation with anyone for the
                            well- being of his country. At the commencement of his reign (if such it
                            may be termed) he Hung himself into an exalted position with possibly
                            more ardour than discretion. He criticised where probably criticism was
                            not merited and certainly not desired, and succeeded within a few months
                            in establishing the reputation of a stormy petrel in the country. But he
                            is no longer in his teens. His Highness to-day is a keen, discerning man
                            of thirty-five, full of intelligent energy, and willing and capable to
                            work for the good of his. subjects, whose wants and aspirations he
                            appreciates surely much better than the casual observers who make it
                            their weekly duty to belittle him in the home Press.</p>
                        <p>In face of the many statements to which I have referred, I am convinced
                            the majority of your readers will agree that he was justified in giving
                            an emphatic and conclusive denial to these libellous creations of
                            imaginative minds ; this I imagine he succeeded in doing in the
                            interview he accorded Mr. Dicey.</p>
                        <p>Naturally, the Khedive’s declarations have caused a great storm in the
                            Nationalist camp. The Nationalists’ organs alternate in ex­pressing
                            unbelief in Mr. Dicey’s interpretation of his Highness’s statements and
                            the declaration that the Nationalist cause is one thing and the
                            Khedive’s personal idea quite another. So far as that goes, Mustapha
                            Pasha Kamel has been consistently honest in declaring that the Khedive
                            has no lot or part in the present Nationalist movement. I believe him.
                            It is not my pleasure to have the personal acquaint­ance of Mustapha
                            Pasha Kamel or any of the gentlemen working on his various newspapers,
                            but it has always struck me that they are conducting a campaign in a
                            legitimate manner : that they purposely and very carefully avoid
                            appealing to the religious sentiment <hi rend="bold">of </hi>the
                            country, and that finally they are in no way responsible for whatever
                            unrest there may be in the country.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the talk of unrest, I might give it an unqualified
                            denial.</p>

                        <p>A Curious Accident.</p>
                        <p>As a train from the Alexandria Sporting Club was going to the city on
                            Saturday even­ing a couple of carts tried to cross in front of it at
                            Chatby. They both succeeded but one of them was stopped by a shawish on
                            reaching the other side of the line, while the other got away. The usual
                            alteration ensued between the carter and the policeman, the former
                            having descended from his box. Meanwhile the cart began to slip backward
                            and fell over the embankment, which was a drop of about four and a half
                            metres. The accident created considerable excitement among the
                            passengers on the train returning from the races. The other cart was
                            afterwards caught by the police.</p>

                                being the man who recently took a room at the Carlton Hotel at
                                Bulkeley and stole valuable jewellry belonging to Messrs. Magnin.of
                                Cherif Pasha street Alex­andria The Alexandria City Police had from
                                the outset strong s- spicions as to the identity of the theif. They
                                obtained the original of the telegram despatched by the man to the
                                Carlton Hotel. On comparing it with his handwriting, of which the
                                police- had specimens, it was seen to tally exactly. As it was known
                                that he had not left the country the ports of departure were watched
                                with the result that he was captured at Port Said. The man is an
                                English gentleman by birth and was once well known in Egypt. He was

                            <p>The Alexandria Swimming Club has reason to congratulate itself upon
                                the opening meet­ing of its fifth season, for it was more
                                success­ful than any season’s inauguration that they have been able
                                to register. Extra interest was added to the meeting by the
                                arrangement of a water polo match against a team from H.M.S.
                                “Diana.” Throughout the match play was very keep, but the ‘Diana”
                                team was over­matched from the start, the Swimming Club being
                                finally victorious by 8 goa’s to nil. The ‘Diana” team was without
                                practice, and the Swimming Club team made an excellent combination,
                                and it was largely due to their cleverness in passing that they were
                                able to claim such a handsome victory. The team from the “Diana”
                                were greatly pleased with the match, and another one has been
                                arranged for next Saturday, when it is not at all im­possible that
                                fortunes will be reversed. A team race of 420 yards, each member of
                                the teams swimming 60 yards, will also be swum be­tween the “Diana”
                                and the club, and judging from Saturday’s form the race should be a
                                very very close and exciting one. In Saturday’s polo match Lloyd,
                                Ecclestone, and Darton, playing forward, were a very useful
                                com­bination, the former two players scoring two goals in the first
                                half, and the last named one. In the second half Ecclestone scored
                                another two goals, and Darton was also responsible for another. The
                                referee of the match was Mr. H. S. Martin, the energetic honorary
                                secretary of the Club. After the polo match and team race of next
                                Saturday there will be a GO yards club handicap.</p>

                                <p>I understand that the new agreement between England and France
                                    and Spain provides for the maintenance of the status quo of
                                    those parts of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic which affects
                                    the freedom of communications of the contracting Powers with
                                    their respective possessions. The agreement, which is
                                    consider­ed as a fresh guarantee of peace, has been communicated
                                    to the other Powers.</p>
                                <p>Saturday’s Cologne “Gazette” says that if three Powers guarantee
                                    the integrity of each other’s possessions, it would be long
                                    before the agreement could be put to a practical test.</p>

                                <p> The “Times” is of the opinion that the true cause of the
                                    dissolution of the Duma is the incompatibility of Parliamentary
                                    Govern­ment with the principles of autocracy. The third Duma is
                                    likely to be even more extremist than the second</p>

                                    postponed taking further action in this matter until after the

                                    take, as it seems to me that it might be of some assistance to

                                    before the matter is again brought before the general

                                <p>“May I therefore request you to let me have your reply in the

                                <p>“I need scarcely say that your response will bee considered as an

                                    have ever found themselves inside a Pasha’s harem. However, he
                                    was taken prisoner by Arabi Pasha’s people, and his
                                    sprightliness and tender years so commended him to his captors
                                    that he was relegated to the custody of Arabi’s family circle.
                                    There he so commended himself that, when the time came for him
                                    to go back to duty, his fair custodians were as loth to let him

                                    All through the spring the lands, which were purchased from the
                                    Cyprus Government last year, were being taken up. The crops were
                                    sown between October and February last, and are now being
                                    reaped. A number of steam ploughs have arrived lately at
                                    Famagusta for the Company’s agricultural operations. This year’s
                                    crops are excellent and threshing has lately begun. Each of the
                                    districts, Famagusta, Larnaca and Limassol, where the company’s
                                    lauds are situated, has a steam thresher. Since last year’s
                                    balance sheet was issued the Company has purchased land at
                                    Famagusta to the extent of a thousand feddans. It will be partly
                                    utilised for the cultivation of cereals and partly for market
                                    gardens. The cost averaged £3. 15s per feddan. At Famagusta nine
                                    new stores have been completed and let since the detailed
                                    statement of the Company’s Operations was published in our

                                    stores are being built. A steam dairy has been established by
                                    the Company at Famagusta and has been working during the last
                                    two months with very satisfactory results. Six branches of the

                                    island. At the beginning of June the amount out on loan was
                                    £40,000. Nearly all the loans are for periods of from 10 to 15

                                    maritime terminus of the Cyprus Government Railway since the new
                                    harbour works have been completed. The customs and railway
                                    receipts are steadily increasing and capital is coming into the
                                    town. During the first three months of this year the returns of
                                    the port totalled more than the whole of the returns during last
                                    year. As the future success and prosperity of the new port is
                                    fully secured and will, in due course of time, be realized, the
                                    property, which the Company now owns there must rise
                                    con­siderably in value.</p>
                                <p>A large part of the land belonging to the Company in Egypt has
                                    been sold during the course of this year. The amount received in
                                    purchase money is £35,000. It was sold at about 25 per cent over
                                    the cost price.</p>
                                <p>In reference to the establishment of the Anglo-Egyptian Land
                                    Allotment in Cyprus it is worth noting that when this company'
                                    began its operations in the island some imaginative Cypriot
                                    Greeks declared that it was a Jewish concern and would aim at
                                    the introduction of Jews into Cyprus. There are very few Jews in
                                    the island and in the last census in 1901 they numbered only 118
                                    persons, owning about 3,500 acres of land, out of a total
                                    population of 237,022. But the Greeks of Cyprus have a terrible
                                    fear of the Jews, dating from the time of Trajan, when the Jews
                                    of Cyprus and of the Eastern Mediterranean generally rose
                                    against the imperial Government, apparently with a view to the
                                    establishment of a separate Jewish state. They are said to have
                                    put to death 240,000 Gentiles in Cyprus, and in consequence it
                                    was enacted that no Jew might even set foot upon the island, and
                                    death there even awaited the shipwrecked Israelite. The dread
                                    caused by this revolt has endured for generations and when the
                                    rumour started that Sir William Willcocks’s company intended to
                                    advance Jewish interests in the island, the local Greek Press
                                    became very alarmed and columns of criticism ensued. The rumour
                                    has died a natural death.</p>

                                <p>This morning a new tug boat, named the “Hercule” arrived for the
                                    Suez Canal Co. The “Hercule” is a sister tug to the “Titan,”
                                    which was built at South Shields some eight years ago, but is
                                    more powerful in fact the “Hercule”, is supposed to have greater
                                    towing power than any vessel of the kind afloat. She is a twin-
                                    screw vessel 150 feet long, her propelling machinery is of 3,000
                                    indicated horse power, and consists of two sets of triple
                                    compound engines. She has a couple of powerful centri­fugal
                                    salvage pumps and a special steam fire pump, to say nothing of
                                    exceptionally strong deck machinery designed in connection with

                                    <p>The directors present herewith to the share­holders their
                                        report and balance sheet for the period dating from the
                                        incorporation of the company to the 31st March 1907, duly
                                        certified by the auditors in accordance with the com­panies
                                        acts.</p>
                                    <p>The company was registered on the 16th February and commenced
                                        business on the 5th April 1906, the accounts therefore cover
                                        a period of rather less than twelve months, and show a net
                                        trading profit of L.E. 12,149,330.</p>
                                    <p>Considering the exceptional conditions exist­ing in the
                                        building trades in Egypt, and that a large proportion of the
                                        capital has only been available for about six months the
                                        directors are of opinion that this result is very satis
                                        factory.</p>
                                    <p>The directors recommend the payment of a dividend of 7%, but
                                        in view of the important contracts which the company have at
                                        present on hand, consider it advisable to defer the payment
                                        of the same for the present.</p>
                                    <p>The hoard were given an opportunity of securing the well
                                        known businesses of Messrs Grant, Bondi and Chinn, sanitary
                                        engineers and Messrs Mark G. Boyes and Co. engineers, upon
                                        very favourable terms, and as their acquisition would very
                                        materially strengthen the position of the Company,
                                        agreements were entered into for the purchase of both
                                        businesses and they accordingly were taken over by this
                                        company from the 1st January 1907.</p>
                                    <p>In order to carry through these agreements the nominal
                                        capital of the company has been increased to £200,000 by the
                                        creation of 100,000 additional ordinary shares of £l each,
                                        according to the company’s articles of associa­tion.</p>
                                    <p>The company have also acquired at a low price two feddans of
                                        land on the banks of the Nile at Rod el Farag, near the
                                        Embabeh Bridge, and are erecting thereon workshops stores
                                        and foundry, with up to date plant and fools. It is the
                                        intention of the directors to remove the various branch
                                        workshops to this centre.</p>
                                    <p>It is anticipated that when these works are completed in the
                                        course of the next few months, they will be able to fulfil
                                        not only all our own requirements but those of other firms
                                        for all kinds of woodwork, castings, etc., and will enable
                                        the company to greatly extend its business.</p>
                                    <p>During the year the company have been successful in obtaining
                                        a number of important contracts with the Egyptian
                                        Governments, the Army of Occupation, public companies and
                                        private individuals.</p>

                                <p>M. Naville evidently considers the tableaux, upon the tomb walls
                                    as merely indicative, or productive, of parallel environment in
                                    the next world for the defunct</p>
                                <p>It is worthy of note, however, that every scene of these
                                    panoramas may be connected also with the provision of a princely
                                    funeral feast. The culture of grain, plants, herbs and flowers,
                                    the harvest and granaries, the cattle rearing, fishing, and
                                    netting of birds, the weaving for funerary garments, papyrus
                                    growing and making for the rituals, seal and signet manufacture
                                    for the priests, beer brewing for beverages, tree cultivation to
                                    build the funeral boat, and make the sleigh, or chariot, for the
                                    sarcophogus, quarrying for the stelae, arid statuette making for
                                    the Ushabtis, and sculp­tor’s for the Ka statues, goldsmiths,
                                    and embroiders for funerary amulets and draperies. The preparing
                                    of animal skins for the boot-sails the writing of the “Book for
                                    the dead,” brick making for the tomb, dressing and cooking all
                                    the menu for the sepulchral banquet, will account for every
                                    action depicted in the Sakkara Mastabas.</p>
                                <p>Is it not possible that the whole “mise eu scene” has a double
                                    object—to describe with much exaggeration the funeral feast
                                    prelimina­ries and functions, here on earth: and to secure it
                                    repetition for the deceased “quand” “qu’il ait une bonne
                                    sepulture dans l’Occident” As M. Naville says the raison d’etre
                                    for the whole custom “must not be applicable” (solely) “to the
                                    tomb in which we find the stela; erected when it was completed,
                                    but to an ideal tomb in the west the duplicate of that an
                                    earth.”</p>
                                <p>If this is so,it appears to us that the Elysian field scenes are
                                    not those of a future “country seat” life of the dead Egyptian,
                                    but the pro­duction of the next world sepulchral service, and
                                    festival. The justified Egyptian is not a squire in a county
                                    home of the Am-Tuat but a fellow passenger with Ra and his crew
                                    of deities in the Sim god’s ship—when having been acquitted hit
                                    he hall of judgment, and his second funeral in hades fulfilled,
                                    he is free to “go in and out and came forth by day.” M. Naville
                                    devotes some space to the question as to whether human sacrifice
                                    was an Egyptian practice, and decides in the negative. As be
                                    says had it been enacted it is inexplicable that among the
                                    innomerable religious tableaux it should be unrepresented. He
                                    refers to the relief in a Theban tomb where two “Nubians” also
                                    styled Anon are apparently going to be executed, and concludes
                                    they were images of men, and the sacrifice was a theatrical one
                                    reminiscent of the execution of Anou prisoners of war in the
                                    early period campaign of Horus celebrated in the “Festival de
                                    frapper les Auou ” That human beings were occasionally imolated,
                                    as elsewhere, he does not deny. The evidence accumulated by M.
                                    Lefebvre in his “Bites Egyptians’* relating to edifices proves
                                    it, but these instances are exceptional and not part of funerary
                                    customs. The chapter upon rites and ceremonies, the divinity of
                                    the king, and the daily worship, has little that is new to
                                    readers of the works of Lefebvre and Moret. M. Naville says “Je
                                    croire que le culte des rois morts n’est qne la prolongation de
                                    celui qu’on leur rendait pendant leur vie. A mon sens les dieux
                                    n’ont pas ete d’abord des morts. Et ceci me conduit a une
                                    conclusion differente de celle de M. Moret Je croire au
                                    contraire qu'ils ont d’abord ete des vivants pour les- quels on
                                    a continue peut-etre en le mopifiaut ou en developpant ce qu’on
                                    faisait pour eux pendant leur vie.</p>
                                <p>This apparently means that the deities possessing temples and
                                    cults in Egypt were deified human beings ; such as Imlotep
                                    probab­ly was, we suppose the tribal chiefs, whose animal emblem
                                    became theirs when deified. To become a god one must have first
                                    been a king, or chief, whilst later to be borne a Pharaoh was to
                                    involve and insure being acclaimed a god.</p>
                                <p>M. Naville says that the amulet, or figure known as the dad or
                                    tah, a sort of double column supporting 4 cross bars is
                                    representa­tive of the spinal column with the projecting ribs of
                                    the vertebrate man, and says the texts leaves us in no doubt as
                                    to this, but he does not quote any one of them.</p>
                                <p>This symbol has mostly been considered to exemplify stability or
                                    firmness, and to have been an hieratic representation of the 4
                                    comer world pillars which support (according to Egyptian
                                    theories) the firmament shown in perspective.</p>
                                <p>We think there is a good deal to be said for this view of the
                                    case and consider the matter at present as undecided.</p>
                                <p>One of the lectures discussed the Doctrine of Heliopolis and the
                                    Egyptian Enneads. The role of Ammon at Thebes, and the religious
                                    reforms of Amenophis IV. These last .it is now- evident were not
                                    induced by any foreign in­fluence. It was a selection of a
                                    particular form of the deity to have offered to him solely, a
                                    type of worship already familiar probably in many temples. It
                                    was not a reform of doctrine but intended to disqualify the
                                    varieties of theology and doctrine which separated the teaching
                                    of the many sacerdotal colleges <hi rend="bold">and </hi>merge
                                    into one form of worship the religious cults of the whole of
