                    <dateline>MONDAY JUNE 17TH 1907.</dateline>
                    <p>A Cairo correspondent of the "Telegraph", in a message dated the 30th. ult.,
                        a summary of which was cabled by our London correspon­dent on the 11th.
                        inst., writes :—</p>
                    <p>As you will have gathered from my cables, practically the sole theme of
                        discussion in the Egyptian local Press, and the factor around</p>
                    <p>which have raged (to put it even mildly), expressions of opinions,
                        conjectures, assertions, accusations, and dementis, has been the article in
                        "The Daily Telegraph" by M Edward Dicey, detailing his interview with his
                        High­ness the Khedive.</p>
                    <p>Naturally enough his Highness's remarks as to the military occupation of
                        Egypt, to the effect that Egypt was too wealthy, and at the same time too
                        weak a country not to fall under the protection of some great European
                        Power, proved the biggest bone of contention ; journalistic amenities have
                        been indulged in as they never were before in my experience of the country,
                        and the howls of derision on the part of the majority of the European
                        journals have been met by aspersions on both the Khedive and Mr. Dicey by
                        the Nationalists.</p>
                    <p>The Khedive, although in residence in Alexandria, has not felt himself
                        constrained to modify or contradict any of Mr. Dicey's statements, and,
                        therefore, despite the conjec­tures of the Nationalist Press, one is bound
                        to accept the interview published as being a substantially veracious and
                        certainly admirably clear version of his Highness's ideas.</p>
                    <p>There can be no logical reason for doubling that the command of the Khedive
                        to see Mr. Dicey before the latter left for home was prompted by the desire
                        to remove by means of publicity in an authoritative British journal,
                        impressions conveyed by the many false and seemingly malicious reports in
                        certain of your contemporaries. I advisedly make this state­ment, although I
                        had not the pleasure of conferring with Mr Dicey in the short interval
                        between his return from the palace and hialmost immediate departure for
                        London.</p>
                    <p>Specific charges had been made against the Khedive by a number of London
                        newspapers. His Highness had been accused in no ambi­guous terms of bribery
                        and corruption, and there were other insinuations which he was unable to
                        nail to the counter in his exalted position as sovereign of a realm by the
                        ordi­nary process of law. What more 'reasonable, then, in this peculiar
                        position, that he should take the one course open to him, i.e., .to declare
                        positively and publicly by means of" the pen of a leading journalist of the
                        day that these obvious slanders and gross inuendoes had no raison
                        d'etre.</p>
                    <p>I suggest he did not protest too much. In my humble judgment the Khedive has
                        distinct right to repudiate by the best means at hand the suggestions which
                        '.during the past few months have distressed and annoyed him, as they would
                        any honest man He stood in the extraordinary position that he could not
                        afford, even against his most ardent desire, to ignore any longer distinct
                        attacks made upon his integrity, and insinuations which, despite his
                        indignant protest, remained uncontradict­ed. His slightest move has been
                        construed into sedition, and his lightest word interpreted as an expression
                        of <hi rend="bold">a virnlent</hi> pan-Islamite— whatever the latter phrase
                        may mean.</p>
                    <p>And what monumental nonsense all this is, and, moreover, what a travesty of
                        the British idea of fair play and justice </p>
                    <p>From a comparatively long experience of Egypt, and having the honour of
                        knowing his Highness the Khedive personally, I am con­vinced that he is only
                        too anxious to work in cordial co-operation with anyone for the well- being
                        of his country. At the commencement of his reign (if such it may be termed)
                        he Hung himself into an exalted position with possibly more ardour than
                        discretion. He criticised where probably criticism was not merited and
                        certainly not desired, and succeeded within a few months in establishing the
                        reputation of a stormy petrel in the country. But he is no longer in his
                        teens. His Highness to-day is a keen, discerning man of thirty-five, full of
                        intelligent energy, and willing and capable to work for the good of his.
                        subjects, whose wants and aspirations he appreciates surely much better than
                        the casual observers who make it their weekly duty to belittle him in the
                        home Press.</p>
                    <p>In face of the many statements to which I have referred, I am convinced the
                        majority of your readers will agree that he was justified in giving an
                        emphatic and conclusive denial to these libellous creations of imaginative
                        minds ; this I imagine he succeeded in doing in the interview he accorded
                        Mr. Dicey.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, the Khedive's declarations have caused a great storm in the
                        Nationalist camp. The Nationalists' organs alternate in ex­pressing unbelief
                        in Mr. Dicey's interpretation of his Highness's statements and the
                        declaration that the Nationalist cause is one thing and the Khedive's
                        personal idea quite another. So far as that goes, Mustapha Pasha Kamel has
                        been consistently honest in declaring that the Khedive has no lot or part in
                        the present Nationalist movement. I believe him. It is not my pleasure to
                        have the personal acquaint­ance of Mustapha Pasha Kamel or any of the
                        gentlemen working on his various newspapers, but it has always struck me
                        that they are conducting a campaign in a legitimate manner : that they
                        purposely and very carefully avoid appealing to the religious sentiment <hi
                            rend="bold">of </hi>the country, and that finally they are in no way
                        responsible for whatever unrest there may be in the country.</p>

                        <p>A Curious Accident.</p>

                            Saturday even­ing a couple of carts tried to cross in front of it at
                            Chatby. They both succeeded but one of them was stopped by a shawish on
                            reaching the other side of the line, while the other got away. The usual
                            alteration ensued between the carter and the policeman, the former
                            having descended from his box. Meanwhile the cart began to slip backward
                            and fell over the embankment, which was a drop of about four and a half
                            metres. The accident created considerable excitement among the
                            passengers on the train returning from the races. The other cart was
                            afterwards caught by the police.</p>

                    <head>ENGLISHMAN ARRESTED.</head>
                    <p>Yesterday an Englishman was arrested at Port Said on suspicion of being the
                        man who recently took a room at the Carlton Hotel at Bulkeley and stole
                        valuable jewellry belonging to Messrs. Magnin.of Cherif Pasha street
                        Alex­andria The Alexandria City Police had from the outset strong s-
                        spicions as to the identity of the theif. They obtained the original of the
                        telegram despatched by the man to the Carlton Hotel. On comparing it with
                        his handwriting, of which the police- had specimens, it was seen to tally
                        exactly. As it was known that he had not left the country the ports of
                        departure were watched with the result that he was captured at Port Said.
                        The man is an English gentleman by birth and was once well known in Egypt.
                        He was at one time in the service <hi rend="bold">of </hi>the Egyptian
                        Government. He has been handed over to the British Consular authorities at

                    <p>The Alexandria Swimming Club has reason to congratulate itself upon the
                        opening meet­ing of its fifth season, for it was more success­ful than any
                        season's inauguration that they have been able to register. Extra interest
                        was added to the meeting by the arrangement of a water polo match against a
                        team from H.M.S. "Diana." Throughout the match play was very keep, but the
                        'Diana" team was over­matched from the start, the Swimming Club being
                        finally victorious by 8 goa's to nil. The 'Diana" team was without practice,
                        and the Swimming Club team made an excellent combination, and it was largely
                        due to their cleverness in passing that they were able to claim such a
                        handsome victory. The team from the "Diana" were greatly pleased with the
                        match, and another one has been arranged for next Saturday, when it is not
                        at all im­possible that fortunes will be reversed. A team race of 420 yards,
                        each member of the teams swimming 60 yards, will also be swum be­tween the
                        "Diana" and the club, and judging from Saturday's form the race should be a
                        very very close and exciting one. In Saturday's polo match Lloyd,
                        Ecclestone, and Darton, playing forward, were a very useful com­bination,
                        the former two players scoring two goals in the first half, and the last
                        named one. In the second half Ecclestone scored another two goals, and
                        Darton was also responsible for another. The referee of the match was Mr. H.
                        S. Martin, the energetic honorary secretary of the Club. After the polo
                        match and team race of next Saturday there will be a GO yards club

                        of the contracting Powers with their respective possessions. The agreement,
                        which is consider­ed as a fresh guarantee of peace, has been communicated to

                    <p>London, Monday.</p>
                    <p>The "Times" is of the opinion that the true cause of the dissolution of the
                        Duma is the incompatibility of Parliamentary Govern­ment with the principles
                        of autocracy. The third Duma is likely to be even more extremist than the
                        second</p>

                    <p>The following circular has been addressed to the British residents of
                        Alexandria by Mr. Robert J. Moss:—</p>
                    <p>"You may have heard that the "Local Inter­national Council" lias postponed
                        taking further action in this matter until after the summer, say next
                        November.</p>
                    <p>"In the hope of keeping in touch with you, I venture to ask the favour of
                        your opinion as to the form the testimonial should take, as it seems to me
                        that it might be of some assistance to us all if the views of the British
                        colony could be ascertained before the matter is again brought before the
                        general public.</p>
                    <p>"May I therefore request you to let me have your reply in the enclosed
                        envelope within the next few days ? I ask this in my capacity as chairman of
                        the meeting, held, on the 2Gth April, at the British Club, Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>"I need scarcely say that your response will bee considered as an expression
                        of opinion with­out prejudice and will in no way be looked upon as
                        interfering with the work of any committee or Council which may be appointed
                        here or elsewhere to discuss the proposal."</p>

                    <p><persName>Mustapha Pasha Ibadi</persName>, Governor of Alex­andria, is
                        leaving Alexandria on Thursday week, the 27th inst. by the Florio-Rubattino
                        steamer for Europe. His Excellency will proceed -by Naples and Rome to the
                        Alps.</p>
                    <p>Captain Dudley de Chair, R.N., who com­manded one of the cruiser escorts of
                        the King and Queen of Denmark on their passage from Flushing, was in the
                        beginning of his career about the time of the Egyptian war, and is one of
                        the very few naval officers who have ever found themselves inside a Pasha's
                        harem. However, he was taken prisoner by Arabi Pasha's people, and his
                        sprightliness and tender years so commended him to his captors that he was
                        relegated to the custody of Arabi's family circle. There he so commended
                        himself that, when the time came for him to go back to duty, his fair
                        custodians were as loth to let him go as, doubtless, he was to leave
                        them.</p>

                    <head>ANGLOEGYPTIAN LAND ALLOTMENT COMPANY.</head>
                    <p>The Anglo-Egyptian Land Allotment Company has been making considerable
                        progress on its Cyprus estates during this year. All through the spring the
                        lands, which were purchased from the Cyprus Government last year, were being
                        taken up. The crops were sown between October and February last, and are now
                        being reaped. A number of steam ploughs have arrived lately at Famagusta for
                        the Company's agricultural operations. This year's crops are excellent and
                        threshing has lately begun. Each of the districts, Famagusta, Larnaca and
                        Limassol, where the company's lauds are situated, has a steam thresher.
                        Since last year's balance sheet was issued the Company has purchased land at
                        Famagusta to the extent of a thousand feddans. It will be partly utilised
                        for the cultivation of cereals and partly for market gardens. The cost
                        averaged £3. 15s per feddan. At Famagusta nine new stores have been
                        completed and let since the detailed statement of the Company's Operations
                        was published in our columns <hi rend="bold">when </hi>the balance sheet
                        appeared. The Fama- gqste branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank has lately
                        moved into the new building erected by the. Company and the Eastern
                        Telegraph Company is in the course of this month moving into its new
                        premises at Famagusta, which have been built by the Company. Besides these
                        buildings a number of new shops and stores are being built. A steam dairy
                        has been established by the Company at Famagusta and has been working during
                        the last two months with very satisfactory results. Six branches of the
                        Company's Agricultural Bank are now at work throughout the island. At the
                        beginning of June the amount out on loan was £40,000. Nearly all the loans
                        are for periods of from 10 to 15 years. Borrowers pay at the rate of 9
                        percent per annum.</p>
                    <p>The centre of the Company's operations in Cyprus is at Famagusta. The
                        prosperity of this port is assured as it lias become the maritime terminus
                        of the Cyprus Government Railway since the new harbour works have been
                        completed. The customs and railway receipts are steadily increasing and
                        capital is coming into the town. During the first three months of this year
                        the returns of the port totalled more than the whole of the returns during
                        last year. As the future success and prosperity of the new port is fully
                        secured and will, in due course of time, be realized, the property, which
                        the Company now owns there must rise con­siderably in value.</p>
                    <p>A large part of the land belonging to the Company in Egypt has been sold
                        during the course of this year. The amount received in purchase money is
                        £35,000. It was sold at about 25 per cent over the cost price.</p>
                    <p>In reference to the establishment of the Anglo-Egyptian Land Allotment in
                        Cyprus it is worth noting that when this company' began its operations in
                        the island some imaginative Cypriot Greeks declared that it was a Jewish
                        concern and would aim at the introduction of Jews into Cyprus. There are
                        very few Jews in the island and in the last census in 1901 they numbered
                        only <measure>118</measure> persons, owning about <measure>3,500</measure>
                        acres of land, out of a total population of <measure>237,022</measure>. But
                        the Greeks of Cyprus have a terrible fear of the Jews, dating from the time
                        of Trajan, when the Jews of Cyprus and of the Eastern Mediterranean
                        generally rose against the imperial Government, apparently with a view to
                        the establishment of a separate Jewish state. They are said to have put to
                        death <measure>240,000</measure> Gentiles in Cyprus, and in consequence it
                        was enacted that no Jew might even set foot upon the island, and death there
                        even awaited the shipwrecked Israelite. The dread caused by this revolt has
                        endured for generations and when the rumour started that Sir William
                        Willcocks's company intended to advance Jewish interests in the island, the
                        local Greek Press became very alarmed and columns of criticism ensued. The
                        rumour has died a natural death.</p>

                    <byline>(From our own Correspondent).</byline>
                    <p>Port Said, Sunday.</p>
                    <p>This morning a new tug boat, named the "Hercule" arrived for the Suez Canal
                        Co. The "Hercule" is a sister tug to the "Titan," which was built at South
                        Shields some eight years ago, but is more powerful in fact the "Hercule", is
                        supposed to have greater towing power than any vessel of the kind afloat.
                        She is a twin- screw vessel 150 feet long, her propelling machinery is of
                        3,000 indicated horse power, and consists of two sets of triple compound
                        engines. She has a couple of powerful centri­fugal salvage pumps and a
                        special steam fire pump, to say nothing of exceptionally strong deck
                        machinery designed in connection with her towage work.</p>

                        Continental Hotel, Cairo, at 5 5' oclock this afternoon:—</p>
                    <p>The directors present herewith to the share­holders their report and balance
                        sheet for the period dating from the incorporation of the company to the
                        31st March 1907, duly certified by the auditors in accordance with the
                        com­panies acts.</p>
                    <p>The company was registered on the 16th February and commenced business on the
                        5th April 1906, the accounts therefore cover a period of rather less than
                        twelve months, and show a net trading profit of L.E. 12,149,330.</p>
                    <p>Considering the exceptional conditions exist­ing in the building trades in
                        Egypt, and that a large proportion of the capital has only been available
                        for about six months the directors are of opinion that this result is very
                        satis factory.</p>
                    <p>The directors recommend the payment of a dividend of 7%, but in view of the
                        important contracts which the company have at present on hand, consider it
                        advisable to defer the payment of the same for the present.</p>
                    <p>The hoard were given an opportunity of securing the well known businesses of
                        Messrs Grant, Bondi and Chinn, sanitary engineers and Messrs Mark G. Boyes
                        and Co. engineers, upon very favourable terms, and as their acquisition
                        would very materially strengthen the position of the Company, agreements
                        were entered into for the purchase of both businesses and they accordingly
                        were taken over by this company from the 1st January 1907.</p>
                    <p>In order to carry through these agreements the nominal capital of the company
                        has been increased to £200,000 by the creation of 100,000 additional
                        ordinary shares of £l each, according to the company's articles of
                        associa­tion.</p>
                    <p>The company have also acquired at a low price two feddans of land on the
                        banks of the Nile at Rod el Farag, near the Embabeh Bridge, and are erecting
                        thereon workshops stores and foundry, with up to date plant and fools. It is
                        the intention of the directors to remove the various branch workshops to
                        this centre.</p>
                    <p>It is anticipated that when these works are completed in the course of the
                        next few months, they will be able to fulfil not only all our own
                        requirements but those of other firms for all kinds of woodwork, castings,
                        etc., and will enable the company to greatly extend its business.</p>
                    <p>During the year the company have been successful in obtaining a number of

                    <p>A NEW WORK UPON ANCIENT EGYPTIAN RELIGION</p>
                    <p>By Joseph OFFORD.</p>
                    <p>(Continued from Saturday)</p>
                    <p>M. Naville evidently considers the tableaux, upon the tomb walls as merely
                        indicative, or productive, of parallel environment in the next world for the
                        defunct</p>
                    <p>It is worthy of note, however, that every scene of these panoramas may be
                        connected also with the provision of a princely funeral feast. The culture
                        of grain, plants, herbs and flowers, the harvest and granaries, the cattle
                        rearing, fishing, and netting of birds, the weaving for funerary garments,
                        papyrus growing and making for the rituals, seal and signet manufacture for
                        the priests, beer brewing for beverages, tree cultivation to build the
                        funeral boat, and make the sleigh, or chariot, for the sarcophogus,
                        quarrying for the stelae, arid statuette making for the Ushabtis, and
                        sculp­tor's for the Ka statues, goldsmiths, and embroiders for funerary
                        amulets and draperies. The preparing of animal skins for the boot-sails the
                        writing of the "Book for the dead," brick making for the tomb, dressing and
                        cooking all the menu for the sepulchral banquet, will account for every
                        action depicted in the Sakkara Mastabas.</p>
                    <p>Is it not possible that the whole "mise eu scene" has a double object—to
                        describe with much exaggeration the funeral feast prelimina­ries and
                        functions, here on earth: and to secure it repetition for the deceased
                        "quand" "qu'il ait une bonne sepulture dans l'Occident" As M. Naville says
                        the raison d'etre for the whole custom "must not be applicable" (solely) "to
                        the tomb in which we find the stela; erected when it was completed, but to
                        an ideal tomb in the west the duplicate of that an earth."</p>
                    <p>If this is so,it appears to us that the Elysian field scenes are not those of
                        a future "country seat" life of the dead Egyptian, but the pro­duction of
                        the next world sepulchral service, and festival. The justified Egyptian is
                        not a squire in a county home of the Am-Tuat but a fellow passenger with Ra
                        and his crew of deities in the Sim god's ship—when having been acquitted hit
                        he hall of judgment, and his second funeral in hades fulfilled, he is free
                        to "go in and out and came forth by day." M. Naville devotes some space to
                        the question as to whether human sacrifice was an Egyptian practice, and
                        decides in the negative. As be says had it been enacted it is inexplicable
                        that among the innomerable religious tableaux it should be unrepresented. He
                        refers to the relief in a Theban tomb where two "Nubians" also styled Anon
                        are apparently going to be executed, and concludes they were images of men,
                        and the sacrifice was a theatrical one reminiscent of the execution of Anou
                        prisoners of war in the early period campaign of Horus celebrated in the
                        "Festival de frapper les Auou " That human beings were occasionally
                        imolated, as elsewhere, he does not deny. The evidence accumulated by M.
                        Lefebvre in his "Bites Egyptians'* relating to edifices proves it, but these
                        instances are exceptional and not part of funerary customs. The chapter upon
                        rites and ceremonies, the divinity of the king, and the daily worship, has
                        little that is new to readers of the works of Lefebvre and Moret. M. Naville
                        says "Je croire que le culte des rois morts n'est qne la prolongation de
                        celui qu'on leur rendait pendant leur vie. A mon sens les dieux n'ont pas
                        ete d'abord des morts. Et ceci me conduit a une conclusion differente de
                        celle de M. Moret Je croire au contraire qu'ils ont d'abord ete des vivants
                        pour les- quels on a continue peut-etre en le mopifiaut ou en developpant ce
                        qu'on faisait pour eux pendant leur vie.</p>
                    <p>This apparently means that the deities possessing temples and cults in Egypt
                        were deified human beings ; such as Imlotep probab­ly was, we suppose the
                        tribal chiefs, whose animal emblem became theirs when deified. To become a
                        god one must have first been a king, or chief, whilst later to be borne a
                        Pharaoh was to involve and insure being acclaimed a god.</p>
                    <p>M. Naville says that the amulet, or figure known as the dad or tah, a sort of
                        double column supporting 4 cross bars is representa­tive of the spinal
                        column with the projecting ribs of the vertebrate man, and says the texts
                        leaves us in no doubt as to this, but he does not quote any one of them.</p>
                    <p>This symbol has mostly been considered to exemplify stability or firmness,
                        and to have been an hieratic representation of the 4 comer world pillars
                        which support (according to Egyptian theories) the firmament shown in
                        perspective.</p>
                    <p>We think there is a good deal to be said for this view of the case and
                        consider the matter at present as undecided.</p>
                    <p>One of the lectures discussed the Doctrine of Heliopolis and the Egyptian
                        Enneads. The role of Ammon at Thebes, and the religious reforms of Amenophis
                        IV. These last .it is now- evident were not induced by any foreign
                        in­fluence. It was a selection of a particular form of the deity to have
                        offered to him solely, a type of worship already familiar probably in many
                        temples. It was not a reform of doctrine but intended to disqualify the
                        varieties of theology and doctrine which separated the teaching of the many
                        sacerdotal colleges <hi rend="bold">and </hi>merge into one form of worship
                        the religious cults of the whole of Egypt</p>
                    <p>Naturally the author quotes more than usual from texts at Der-elBahari also
                        from other literature first edited by himself such as "The Myth of the
                        Destruction of Mankind by the Gods" but all the more important publications
                        of inscriptions and papyri are drawn upon and a short, but select,
                        bibliography is appended to each chapter.</p>

                    <p>Les bénéfices industriels de l'année 1906 ont atteint L.K 5016; mais, après
                        déduction des frais d'administration, intérêts, amortissements et dépenses
                        extraordinaires, c'est par un déficit de LE. 1060 que se solde l'exercice.
                        En ajoutant à ce chiffre le déficit à fin 1905, on arrive au total global de
                        L.E. 14.207,qui représente le solde débiteur à fin 1906. La décision prise
                        par l'Assemblée Générale Extraordinaire, teuue à Bruxelles, le 20 Avril
                        dernier, de réduire le capital de moitié, permettra de rayer complètement ce
                        passif du bilan futur et d a- mortir, en outre, d'une seule fois, les primes
                        sur les émissions d'obligations ainsi que les frais d'inscription
                        hypothécaire, tout en con stituant à la Société une réserve de 17 %
                        environ.</p>
                    <p>La fabrication a produit en 1906 20.307 tonnes de ciment, dont il a été vendu
                        19016 tonnes. Il reste un stock total de 3662 tonnes. En 1905 les ventes
                        n'avaient été que de 6531 tonnes. Pour les 5 premiers mois de 1907 elles
                        atteignent 10548 contre 6435 en 1906. Le pied de production actuel, qui est
                        de 30000 tonnes, va être porté à 36000, des contrats assurant l'écoulement
                        d'une telle quantité pour 1908- 1910 étant déjà passés avec divers
                        clients.</p>
                    <p>Comparé avec celui de 1905, le bilan de 1906 montre une notable nmélioiation,
                        puisque la perte a été réduite à L. E. 1060, tandis qu'en 1905 elle avait
                        été de 6825.</p>
                    <p>L'émission nouvelle des 15,000 actions privilégiées de 50 francs, en vue de
                        reconstituer le capital social diminué de moitié aura lieu en Novembre
                        prochain. Cette émission, déduction faite des frais d'émission, produira une
                        somme de 700000 fr., qui permettra de rembourser en intérêts et capital les
                        318000 fr. de la Caisse des Propriétaires, ainsi que les 200000 fr. avancés
                        par la Banque d'Athènes. Il restera 180000 fr. pour acquérir le matériel
                        nécessaire et agrandir les installations en vue de mettre l'usine sur un

                    <p>Patient laid up in Bed for 10 Months at a time, Disabled and Helpless.</p>
                    <p>4, York street,</p>
                    <p>Bilston, Staffs., England</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen : — I will always do what I can towards making your Doan's Backache
                        Kidney Pills better known, because they have proved such a blessing to me,
                        and I believe in them. I have been a martyr to rheumatism ever since I was
                        20 years of age, and now I am 54 When quite a young man I had to walk with
                        crutches or sticks. This went on for over tliree years, and since that time
                        I have never l>een properly free from the rheumatism, but never so free as I
                        am at the present time, since using Doan's Pills.</p>
                    <p>During those 34 years I had several severe attacks of this terrible
                        rheumatism. The one in October of 1897, when I was living in Wed- nesbury,
                        was, I think, the severest attack I ever had ; it kept me in my bed for 10
                        months, -and I became as helpless as a new born babe. 1 was attended by one
                        of the best doctors, but he seemed unable to do me much good, although he
                        told me more than once that if I had been a millionaire he could not have
                        tried harder—and I believe him.</p>
                    <p>In March of 1899 I was kept from business for 17 months again with rheumatisn
                        and kidney trouble. There were severe pains in my back and sides
                        (esjiecially the left side) ; my appetite became poor, and I didn't relish
                        the food I was able to eat. There was a nasty taste in my mouth, no matter
                        what 1 ate or drank, and I couldn't keep my food down. Even a pipe of
                        tobacco seemed to go against me, and I became despondent and miserable,
                        feeling that life was not worth living.</p>
                    <p>But there was worse to follow : not long after, I began to be troubled with
                        the "kidney secretions, the pain in passing being almost unbearable at
                        times. There was also a sediment from the urine. These distressing
                        complaints kept getting worse and worse as months went by, until one day I
                        couldn't pass the urine at all ; I was in such a terrible condition at the
                        time that I thought my race was nearly run.</p>
                    <p>It was then that I heard about Doan's Backache Kidney Pills, and they were
                        spoken so highly of that I determined to try them. After I had taken a few
                        boxes I felt easier, and now that I have taken ten boxes I feel quite free
                        from any sign of rheumatism or kidney trouble. I am a new man to what I was,

                                the same time that a grave constitutional reform is enunciated in

                            <p>A crisis has occurred in the Dunm. M. Stolypin demanded the exclusion
                                of 55 members wilom, he alleged, were concerned in a com-jpiracy to
                                establish a Republic; He also ^Cîmanded the arrest of 16 of them.
                                The Duma, despite the Government's opposition, referred the matter
                                to a committee. The dissolution of the Duma is regarded as
                                probable.</p>

                                Russian in spirit; other nationalities in the Empire will be
                                represented but not in sufficient number to enable them to decide
                                purely Russian questions. Where the people had not attained
                                sufficient civic development the elections would be temporarily
                                suspended.</p>
                            <p>Simultaneously a new electoral law proclaimed which reduces the
                                membership of the Duma from 524 to 442. In Poland, Siberia, and the
                                Caucasus the elections will be held under special regulations.
                                Poland loses 26 deputies.</p>
                            <p>The manifesto expresses disappointment at the conduct of many of the
                                members of the Duma. It refers to the conspiracy of 15th November
                                and the failure of the Duma to suspend the accused members, for
                                which reason it had been dissolved.</p>
                            <p>The dissolution was received quietly here. The city is full of
                                troops, quartered in the principal thoroughfares. Extraordinary
                                measures have been taken to ensure order. Rioting is practically
                                impossible. The Prefect has prohibited hostile press comments.
                                Numerous arrests have been made already, including 9 of the accused
                                members of the Duma. (Reuter)</p>

                                President of the Conference. He said that their task was to seek a
                                means of amicably settling differences between States and thus
                                arresting the cause of irritation, and secondly to migrate the
                                effects of war, alike for combattants and those indirectly affected.

                    <p>Rather damp and uncomfortable weather prevailed, and the meeting seemed to
                        lack the brilliancy and animation of a professional meeting, although on the
                        whole sport was good and no fault conld be found with the quality and
                        quantity of the horses competing Prom the attendance when the first race was
                        rung up it almost looked as if the meeting would be a disappointment but
                        things livened up later on, and the afternoon's sport was enjoyed by those
                        who were present. Considerable interest was centred upon the match between
                        Saiadll and Moofid. At their last meetingSaiad II Was third with Moofid
                        unplaced the latter conceding 10 lb. With now only 7 lb. difference in the
                        weights Saiad II admirably ridden by Whiteside confirmed this running by
                        winning fairly easily. There was very little to choose between them until
                        entering the straight when Thompson had to wake Moofid up with the whip, but
                        Whiteside riding ooolly had him beaten and passed the post a couple of

                    <head>A WARNING IN SEASON.</head>
                    <p>HOW TO CURE LASSITUDE-</p>
                    <p>Our duty is to forewarn you against anemia and lassitude, which are prevalent
                        in times of great heat. The feebleness gains on you slowly, and you do not
                        consequently take sufficient notice of it. This is exactly where you do
                        wrong ; there is always a certain amount of danger in letting the system
                        grow feeble, however slightly. If the heat lias at all upset you, we would
                        strongly advise you to take Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. They will not fail to
                        arrest, by giving an increased quantity of blood and new strength, your
                        weakness. In submitting to you the statement of M. Minarioni Lidovico de
                        Dorgali (Prov. de Sassari), Italy, we are only doing our duty,for, if we say
                        that Dr. Williams' Piûk Pills for Pale People possess such and süch a
                        virtue, we must also furnish you with the proof.</p>
                    <p>M. Marioni Ludovico writes : About three years ago I began to be ansemic. I
                        was pale and I didn't feel fit for anything. I developed these various
                        ailments as the result of bronchitis. My health was bad, I had lost all
                        appetite, I digested with difficult)', and I could not sleep. I sometimes
                        was overcome with giddiness, and I suffered greatly from headaches. I tried
                        various remedies, but obtained uo relief I had even given up hope of ever
                        regaining anything like good health until one day, while reading of a cure
                        obtained by Dr. Williams' Ping Pills, which was published in a journal, I
                        made up my mind I would tiy once more, and the result is that to day I am in
                        perfectly good health. " Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People are
                        unquestionably efficient in all cases of amemia, chlorosis, neurasthenia,
                        general weakness, all stomach ills, riieumatism, and nervous debility.</p>
