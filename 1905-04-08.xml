                    <head>Local theatre fire</head>
                    <p>The Abbas Ilelrny Theatre at Alexandria was destroyed by fire at an early
                        hour this morning. Yesterday evoning, the usual performance was given by
                        Gatti’s circus troupe,which ended at a quarter past midnight. At 12.20 a.m.
                        the dynamo which supplies the electric light for tho theatre was stupped,
                        and by 12.40 a.m. everyone connected with the theatre had left the building,
                        nothing untoward having hap- pened. At half-past one in the morning,
                        however, the alarm was Jgiven to the Fire Brigade that the “Abbas” was on
                        fire, and on arriving on the spot a few minutes afterwards they found the
                        large building in flames. The fire, which had apparently originated under
                        the stage, had Spread with 'alarming rapidity to the auditorium and boxes,
                        and in a short time the theatre resembled one vast roaring luruace.
                        'Fortunately, no one was in the building at the time; aud there was. no loss
                        of life. 'The horses belonging to the circus troupe were, however, stabled
                        under the stage and efforts were at once directed to saving the, animals.
                        This was done, though three of the horses unfortunately were charred by the
                        flames before they could be got out. v Little or none of the belongings of
                        the unfortunate artistes belonging to the circus troupe cou.d be saved, as
                        the conflagration had got a strong hold of the building. The efforts of the
                        Fire Brigade were mainly directed to saving the walls of the theatre and the
                        sur- rounding buildings, and it reflects great credit ou them that the lire
                        was so successfufly kept wiihiu hounds, none of the adjacent buildings being
                        affected. Bhortly after the outbreak the toot of the building collapsed with
                        a tremen- dous crash, aud now nothing remains of the theatre but ‘the four
                        walls, the whole place being entirely gutted. By 5 o’clock tms morning the
                        fire was thoroughly mastered by tne Brigade, but the hremeh are still
                        engaged in pumping water ou the smouldering mass ol charred wood- work and
                        distorted iron pillars. The cause of the outbreak has not as yet been
                        ascertained, and the sympathies of all .will be with the proprietors,

                        by insurance. Thp theatre was built in 1834 aud was valued at something like
                        £16,0011.</p>

                    <p>The Procnreur General thus oonolndes his review of crime:— That the inorease
                        in orime, properly so called,' is less by half in 1904 than in; 1903, while
                        criminal robbery has not risen (it has in fact fallen by 20)—that the rise
                        in dMits is small in comparison with that of tbe last years, and no more
                        than what might be fairly expected ; that such increase as there is
                        accounted for by petty oases of assault and by a more -exacting standard in
                        the Matter of false accusations while theft and crop-destroying have
                        decreased, and cattle-poisoning not in- creased ; all this, while it oannot
                        be oalled a brilliant result, at least indicates a less marked tendency of
                        serious orime to remain on the increase, and is, so far, a matter for

                    <p>The state of things, at present, is far from encouraging, and it is not
                        astonishing that native reformers should be at length awaken- ing to the
                        urgent necessity of serious re- forms in these Courts. Notably, in suits
                        concerning private Wakfs, scarcely a week passes without some more or less
                        serious com- plaint being received at this Ministry. The majority ol these
                        private Wakf suits are pure questions of property and private rights and do
                        not in any way affeot the religion of the people. Some of the more
                        enlightened among native reformers therefore consider that the wisest and
                        most satisfactory solution for all concerned would be for the Mehkamehs to
                        hand overfall that relates to private Wakfs (Wakfs Ahly) to the Native
                        Tribunals, retain- ing their competence in charitable Wakfs only (Wakts
                        Khairy) which, being, of a more spiritual nature, fall mbre properly within
                        the jurisdiction of religious Courts. This would certainly be a solution of
                        the difficulty and itt> leasibihty is under the consideration of the
                        Government. r </p>
                    <p>There has been some attempt, in quarters hostile to the project* _ to make
                        capital out of the case of Mr. 'Beck and the stinHulus which that deplorable
                        affair has given in England to a revival ol the agitation for a Court of
                        Criminal Appeal. It may therefore perhaps be desirable to say a lew words on
                        this subject. The suggestion is, of course, that the Egyp- tian'Goverument
                        is proposing to abolish tlyi very safeguard which that case has shown to‘be
                        imperatively necessary. Two considerations suffice to demonstrate -the
                        fallacy iff this con- tention. The .first is that there is no real analogy
                        between the functions of the Egyptian Court of Criminal Appeal—which it is
                        proposed to suppress -here^—and those of the English Court ot Criminal
                        Appeal—which it is desired to introduce at home. The one reviews, on the
                        papers, jthe findings of (act of Tribunals which have heard the witnesses;
                        the other would eitheT rehear the case de novo, witnesses and all, or else
                        order anew trial at which the witnesses would be reheard. Whatever ad-
                        vantages, therelore, might attach to the latter sj8tem—>they are highly
                        problematical, the question being, as is generally admitted, an exceedingly
                        controversial one—they are clearly not poMeased by the Egyptian institution
                        which only exceptionally hears the witnesses. The secoud consideration is
                        that the learned Commissioners appointed to iuquire into the Beck case, and
                        report thereon to-the Home Becretary, have not, as a matter of fact, seeu
                        fit to recommend the institution of a Court of Criminal Appeal, which they
                        apparently regard —aud, it is submitted, rightly (1)—as calculat- ed to
                        impair the dignity aud finality of the stti unices of the existing Criminal
                        Courts. They content themselves with reoommending that some machinery should
                        be provided for secur* ing the possible oousidcration, by a superior Court,
                        of crucial poiuts of law decided by the judge at the trial. Such machinery
                        already exists, in the Egyptian system, in the powers of the Court of
                        Cassation, before which any oonvicted person has the faculty of showiug that
                        a point of law bas beeu erroneously decided, to his disadvantage, and that
                        he has consequently not had a fair trial, or that his oonviction is bad in
                        law. If he suoceeds, the Court of Cassation either quashes the conviction or
                        orders a new trial. We may, therefore, dismiss the idea that, the Beck case
                        has any real bearing on the question of Assize Courts for Egypt. The qnes
                        tiou remains yrhether, in any other respect, the situation has undergone any
                        change since last year. Unfortunately it would appear that, it there has
                        been any change, it has been tor the worse, crime having again increased, as
                        may be seen from the report of the Procnreur General, though not, I am glad
                        to say, in the same ratio as in the preceding year.</p>

                    <p>After citing various oases to prove the defective drafting o * the Egyptian
                        Civil Code, the Judioial Advisei remarks :— But it is not only in the
                        drafting that Egyp- tian legislation is defective but also in the total
                        omission of a number of important subjects and the locume and obscurities in
                        the provisions regarding others. Thus Egyptian legislation contains no law
                        of copyright, no law ef patents, no )»w of trade mark* and Egypt has
                        conssqueitly been unable to adhere to the various International Conventions
                        relat- ing to these most important subjects. There are constant compla inta
                        from the commercial communities as to he loss and inoonvenienoe caused to
                        them by tbe absence of a satisfactory law on these questions of every-day
                        applica- tion. Again, the lan i law is very defective. The law of easements
                        {servitudes) is so brief and incomplete as to givi i rise to constant
                        difficulties. Wakfs aqd contracts of a similar nature are governed
                        exolusivsly by Mohamedan law, which varies according to the different rite*
                        not to mention the divergences in the views of the various authorities of
                        the same rite. Obviously the only remedy for a body of legis- lation so
                        radically defeotive is to simplify the modus legiferendi in Egypt. That the
                        Egyptian Government should be oompelled to apply to fourteen Powers whenever
                        it is desired- to efieot an improvement in Codes of the oalibre above
                        described or to provide legislation cm subjects of the importance above
                        referred to is obviously absurd</p>

                    <p>In regard to the provisions of the above project, the Judicial Adviser
                        remarks: “It would undoubtedly effect a very considerable change in the
                        existing system and there can be very little doubt that the change would
                        prove beneficial to the community at large. Indeed the defects of the
                        present system are almost universally recognised and its continued existence
                        is mainly due to the circumstance that it has hitherto proved impossible to
                        formulate an acceptable’ scheme ’ to take its place. Now, howeve^ that such
                        a scheme Jras been voted by a majority of the technical delegates, it is
                        greatly to be hoped that political considerations may not induce the Powers
                        to vhto the projeot and deprive Egypt of the benefits of a reform for whioh
                        she has been struggling for so many years.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday the troopship “Dilwara” left Southampton with artillery and
                        infantry drafts and various details on board for Gibraltar and Malta.
                        Amongst the officers is Major C. L. E. Eustace-Robertson, D.S.O., King’s
                        Royal Rifle Corps, who joins the 1st Battalion at Cairo. The “Dilwara” is
                        due at Malta on the 2nd April and at Southampton on the 11th follow- ing.
                        Her return will dose the trooping season of 1904-03. Captain Claude 3.
                        Hawker, Coldstream Guard* commanding the Camel Corps of the Egyptian Army,
                        has just been promoted to field rank in the Guards. Major Hawker entered the
                        Guards close on fifteen years ago, the last six of which hare been spent in
                        the Khedivefa service. He earned' tile Egyptian medal with clasps for the
                        operations against tbe Khalifa in 1899, shortly after he joined the Egyptian
                        Army. .A Captain S. J. Somerville, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, attached
                        lately to the Indian Army, has been restored to the establishment of the
                        inniskillings vice Captain R. C. Piero* appoint- ed adjutant of the 8rd
                        Battalion. A feeling has been created that the War Office is trying to
                        conceal the names of the fraudulent contractors in connection with the Cape
                        Stores scandal. On the other hand, Mr. Arnold-Forster has given all the
                        knowledge he possessed on the matter. There is every reason to believe that
                        every difficulty was put in the way of his doing so. The battleship "London”
                        (Captain Philip F. Tillard), which was commissioned at Ports- mouth on the
                        7th Juu* 1902, for service with the Mediterranean Fleet; will return home

                        Tavernier. I used to think that these weirs were altogether artificial, bnt
                        an examination of the site has made me think that they were natural bars of
                        .vory hard conglomerate, as hard as. the compactest crys- talline limestone,
                        which overlay stiff clay. The crests of the weirs wore probably artifi-
                        cially raised. This conglomerate can bo seen to-day.along the left bank of
                        the river from Samarra to nearly opposite Boled. It has a thickness of over
                        ip metres at Samarra, and under it can be seen some 6 metres of stiff ~*any
                        above the water’s edge of the Tigris. The conglomerate dips under the
                        allurvum of the Tigris below Beled and its termination was in Probability a
                        great cataract near Beled known .ally as "Sadd Nimrud,” or Nimrod’s dam.
                        'file Nahrwan and Dijail canals look out from above these weire^ .The
                        Nahrwan canal was ruined by the Tigris changing its course, and the
                        undermining and sweeping away of these great cataracts sealed the ruin of
                        all the irrigation systems fed by the Tigris. From Beled to Bagdad the
                        Tigris has a length of about 110 kilometres, and a width of from 4
                        kilometres to 350 'metres. Where the river is wide, it flows over a bed of
                        shingle and has a velocity pf some 6 to 7 kilometres per hour. Navigation by
                        sailing boats is impossible against the current.</p>
                    <p>From Bagdad to Gurnn,whore tho Tigris and Euphrates meet, the river has a
                        length of 740 kilometres. The distance from Gnrna to Basra is 60 kilometres,
                        and 100 kilometres further on is the Persian Gulf. Tho distances along the
                        Tigris are therefore as follows . . ' From Beled to tho Sea J 1010
                        kilometres From Bagdad to Basra 800 „ From Bagdad to the Sea 900 „
                        After.leaving the rapids at Beled, the bed of tftj Tigris, like that of the
                        Euphrates, is'every- where mud. The watere are yellow like those of the
                        Tiber and the Euphrates. Bagdad is the real northern terminus of river
                        navigation on the Tigris. It has taken, the place of the ancient Opis, which
                        was further north</p>

                    <head>Letter to editor</head>
                    <p>A QUEER GRAMMAR. To rta Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—In reply to
                        “Grammarian’s” lette.r in yesterday’s “Gazette,” I hive to inform him:— .(1)
                        Not long before reviewing Dirr’s Arabic Grammar, the “Gazette” published my
                        opinion of another grammar of the classical language, which was most
                        flattering and which was afterwards shared by the editor of a well-known
                        literary Arabic periodical inJJairo in his review of it (2) ’ Before sending
                        in mf artiole on Dirr’s grammar I gave the book to a native friend (who is a
                        competent Arabio scholar) to read and return to me with his opinion. He
                        brought it after a few days and told me what he thought of it in fewer but
                        severer words than I used. I then gave him my article to read and he
                        approved of every word I said. Moreover, I have not yet met one who knew the
                        book and did not share my opinion of it (3) Since sending my article to the
                        "Ga- zette” 1 have learned that the book had been sent to an Euglish
                        gentleman who is a well- known Arabic scholar, but although he refused to
                        review it he marked here and there what he considered flagrant errors. The
                        reason of his refusal is therefore not far to seek. . (4) I confirm every
                        word I said in my review, but I cannot enter into any discussion with one
                        who makes the ridioulous statement that it is grammatically correct to say
                        el ingi- lyz tayiba because he means the English as a nation, and pretends
                        that most of the other mistakes are obvious slips. (5) "Grammariau” has the
                        fault of more than one other resident in the country who no sooner- picks
                        up? a few words of Arabio (and before he could write a sentence correctly
                        without the aid of some one else) than be rushes.to the press with a
                        wonderful grammar of his own. It would have been better for “Grammarian” to
                        study the language for many more years before venturing to write a book
                        dealing with it (6) "Grammarian’’ will have to get all the , mistakes I
                        pointed out, and many more, cor- ; need before the book ceases to be called
                        a . "queer’’ grammar.. As regards his personal reference to me, there is no
                        need for me to reply, as this sort of controversial method is beneath
                        oontempt.— Yours very truly, The Whiter of the Review.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Justice Kekewich in the Chancery Divi- sion on,Tahsday w§ek continued the
                        hearing of the notion in whioh'Dr. Robert William Eelkin Rued the Palmerston
                        Industrial and Finance Corporation, Ltd., and Mr. Alfred -Bridge, a company
                        promoter, of-15, Cockspur-street, W., claiming rescission of an agreement to
                        take 800 shares in the Sudan Exploration, Ltd., and a declaration that
                        defendants were liable to indemnify the plaintiff in respect of all expen-
                        ses incurred by him in relation to the transac- tion, or in the alternative
                        damages for alleged misrepresentation. The corporation denied that its
                        policy or business was controlled by Bridge, and did not admit that the
                        representations alleged to have been made by him were made on behalf of the
                        corporation or with its know- ledge. The.defendant Bridge pleaded that if he
                        did. make any representations or statements concerning the present or future
                        value of the shares they were bona fide expressions of opi- nion. Defendant
                        Bridge counter-claimed againit the plaintiff for alleged misrepresentation.—
                        Mr. P. Ogden Lawrence, K. C. and Mr. J; H. Simmons appeared for plaintiff,
                        Mr. Ashton Cross for the Palmerston Corporation, and Mr. W. J. L Ambrose for
                        Mr. Bridge. Plaintiff, continuing his evidence, said that up to the issue of
                        the writ in this action he had never received a certificate for or transfer
                        of the 800 shares in the . Sudan Exploration, Ltd.</p>
                    <p>In cross-examination by Mr. Ashton Cross, for the Palmerston Corporation,
                        plaintiff said he knew the property whioh the Siidan Explo- ration had been
                        formed to acquire. From his knowledge of the country witness believed the
                        company's property to be valuable. Ho wa3 anxious to g|t some Sudan sbures
                        if he could pay cash for them. The 10$. nominal shares could not be obtained
                        for less than £1. Ho Btill believed in tho success of the Sudan Company if
                        it was well managed. Mr. Ashton Cross said he agreed that the Palmerston
                        Corporation sold the shares to Dr. Felkip and those shares had been
                        delivered. Plaintiff, >n auswer to counsel, said ho be- lieved that the 800
                        shares were in the Sudan Company's hands' for transfer. In cross-examination
                        by ' Mr. Ambrose, plaintiff said he understood that the Palmerston
                        Corporation was to put the shares on the mar- ket at-£2 when the
                        pooling-arrangement came to an end. He always understood that Bridge was
                        actiug for the Palmerston Corporation. This concluded plaintiff's case, and
                        Mr. Ashton Cross, submitting that ho case had been made out against the
                        corporation, called Mr. Allred Bridge, who described himself as a director
                        of. the Palmerston Corporation, of which,he said,tho plaintiff also beoamo a
                        direc- tor. When the question of the Sudan Explora- tion shares was uuder
                        discussion, plaintiff said that if he went into the matter ho should want a
                        share of the profits, and witness then told him he had better become a
                        director. Plaintiff, said witness, worked hand-in-hand with him in the Sudan
                        matter, and advised the corporation to take up the shares. Witness denied
                        that he ever made any representations to induce plaintiff to go into the
                        share transaction, and he said that Dr. Felkin must have understood the
                        whole transaction.</p>
                    <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Lawrence, witness said that he was a company promoter,
                        and prior to his going to Cockspur-street he carried on business at 8,
                        Union-court, FC., where he promoted a number of companies. May I take it
                        that, all the companies you promoted oome to grief?—No.—Witness men- tioned
                        the Pan-African Syndicate, Ltd., and the London and Provincial Dairy Company
                        as suocossful promotions. Witness denied that at the time he
                        left'Union-courtoxocutions were out against him at his office and at his
                        house at Surbiton. Wore there any baukruptcy petitions present- ed against
                        you ?—Yes. May I tako it that altogether 8, Union-court, got too hot for yon
                        at tho time you migrated to the West End ?—No, not at all.—Witness said he
                        sometimes advertised for directors willing to invest It was not true to
                        suggest that witness was the Palmerston Corporation. He agreed that there
                        was no entry in the mi- nute-books concerning the agreement with tho
                        plaintiff. At the date of the signing of the bill by the plaintiff witness
                        admitted that the only transfer of Sudan shares to the Palmer ston
                        Corporation was one for 600 shqres. They had, however,’ made arrangements to
                        acquirejurther shares.</p>

                    <p>The abovo teams met at Abbassieh xm Wednesday last. Both teams hold a good
                        record. The K.R.R’s, it seems, have not been defeated sinoe 1902, whereas
                        the representatives of the Shamrook have only been beaten onoe in some
                        sixtyodd matches,60 a good game was expected. The pitch was in splendid
                        order as the Irishmen took the field in the following order : Goal, Dadgeon
                        ; backs, Shanks and Reid ; halves, Millar, Nixon, and Smyth ; forwards,
                        Todd, Hutton, Cunningham, Fallon, and Walsh. The Rifles won the spin of the
                        coin and defended the city goals. There would be almost 900 spectators
                        present when Cunningham commenced operations.. The opening minutes proved
                        sensational as the Inuiskillings bom- barded the Rifles’ goal for fully five
                        minutes. The custodian clearing the Rifles now broke away per Bibbleton, but
                        Smyth robbed and returned. Todd getting possession centred well bnt Fallon
                        sent behind. On the kick-off tho Rifles took play towards Dudgeon, but the
                        latler was not to be oanght napping and cleared in Gillispie’s best style.
                        At this stage the referee (a sergeant of the K.KR.’s) had occasion to retire
                        owing to a misunderstanding of the roles, Mr. MoKenzie, Royal Engineers,
                        filling the vacanoy (amid cheers). On play being resumed Cunningham got away
                        and sent across to Todd, who outwitted two opponents and seut strongly into
                        goal, where Fallon headed over the bar. Flay remained in midfield, until
                        Fallon broke away, but when in a good position ho was! fouled by Bibbleton.
                        A fight ensued, both players being oantioned. The Rifles’ right wiug now got
                        away but Smyth intercepted and returned. Some very spirited play ’took place
                        around the Rifles’ goal. At last, however, the custodian cleared. The
                        Irishmen were now ’ having the best of matters and a shot of Cunningham's
                        deserved a better fate. A free against the Green and Buff Brigade proved
                        unproductive. It was close on half-timo as Hutton gave the Dark Greens’
                        defence some trouble. Half-time now arrived with the repre- seratives of the
                        Shamrock pressing for all they were worth,but there was no score yet on
                        either side.</p>
                    <p>After the usual refreshments both teams took tho field. The first thing
                        noticeable was a great sprint by Todd. The ball, however, found touch. The
                        Rifles now took play in hand, but Smith robbed the right wing -time after
                        time. A corner to the Rifles looked ridrie too rosy for the Green and Buff
                        Brigade, HoWeker Nixon cleared and the InniskUliugs were seen fio advantage.
                        Walsh, however, ran the ball ovet tho liue. On the kick off Bibbleton got
                        away, on his own, but Smith was on his track aneb blocked his passage once
                        more. Not to be deniod, the Rifles got down towards Dudgeon and scored, but
                        Johnny Bibbleton was given offside. On resuming, Millar got away on his own,
                        and alter dodging a couple of opponents sent across to Cunningham, who had a
                        good try for goal. The Rifles now pulled themselves togother and worked
                        their way down towards Dudgeon but Nixon and Smith were not to be beaten so
                        easily and play was once more trans- ferred, when Hutton got well away and
                        gave to Todd, who aont in a "daisy cutter” to tho Custodian, who fell on the
                        ball but too late, as Fallou gut the ball at his toe and into the net it
                        went, drawing first blood for the Innis- killings amidst deafening cheers.
                        Oa the ball being centred the K.RR’s got away but’ Reid returned the ball.
                        Great was the excitement that now prevailed (at this stage Mion was injured
                        and had to retire). Both teams were now playing a most determined and very
                        hard game. If anything, the Inniskillingswere having tho best of matters at
                        this stage. The shield holders were playing a fine combination game. It was
                        a treat to watoh the five forwards play so woll considering tho
                        circumstances under which they were placod. It was now wearing np to
                        full'time as Walsh missed the much desired spot by inches.
                        Shortlyafterthereferee’s whistle sounded for full time, leaving the
                        Inniskillings winners of one of the most exciting games that ever took place
                        in Cairo, and still undefeated. Final result 2nd Royal Inniskilling
