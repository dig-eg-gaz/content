                    <head>OUR NEW WORLD-POLICY. </head>
                    <p>For many months past preparation has been going on for launching a project of
                        such tremendous consequence that its advocates in England never venture to
                        describe it in the few and simple words which convey its whole meaning. In
                        Japan they are more bold. There they write and speak not of more renewal of
                        the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, but of a new engage ment altogether: a compact
                        extensive and protective of the Empire of Japan for the one part, and, for
                        the other, defensive of the British Empire in the East from European
                        aggression. In plain terms, a firm fighting alliance against all comers, but
                        particularly and especially against Continental Europe. A broad sketch of
                        the intention and purposes of this compact was put before the readers of the
                        "Timer," about four months ago, by the Tokio correspondent of that journal.
                        Than the Tokio correspondent of the "Times" there is no abler or more
                        authori- tative exponent of what Japan wishes to be known or thought in
                        England; and what he said in opening the matter to the British public was
                        this. The Japanese foresee that it will be wise, even necessary, to provide
                        a means of safeguarding the larger Empire that will be the reward of
                        victory. "With the acqui sition of Saghalien the interests demanding
                        protection would not be limited to China and Korea they would be
                        considerably extended." To keep this extension secure, Japan is pre- pared
                        to pay a great price. England has brought against herself a new grievance
                        and a new danger in Thibet: Japan is willing to see her through whatever
                        difficulty may arise in that matter. England has still to make herself safe
                        in Persia and Afghanistan. "Her defensive armour is vulnerable in both
                        regions. Japan is ready to be a part of that armour... Let each ally have
                        equal duties and equal benefits." Japan can put 800,000 men into the field.
                        "Suppose that England can command the services of such an army, and can
                        supple ment it by her own fleet plus the squadrons of Japan," would not
                        England, would England and Japan together, be able to impose peace wherever
                        aggression dared to lift its head? In the words of the Ji-ji Shimpo, the
                        situation would be controlled by Anglo-Saxondom with Japan. Since those
                        winning suggestions first appeared Port Arthur has fallen, Kuropatkin's army
                        ha- been utterly routed, and we now read in our newspapers that the new
                        alliance is to ali intents and purposes an accomplished fact. Thanks to the
                        good sense and determination of the English people, we have adopted an
                        entirely new world-policy the pivot of which is at Tokio, its strength the
                        wisdom, bravery, and unalterable friendship of the Japanese. In truth, of
                        course, these are not assertions but strategic assumptions, such as are
                        often employ- ed to create or enhance a desirable state of feeling in the
                        country. But no state of feeling can be thought desirable which is worked
                        into a passion of determination while the conditions that should determine
                        it have yet to come into existence. And that is exectly how the matter
                        stands in this case at present. The alliance with Japan which was concluded
                        in January 1902 will remain in force till the war is over, and till the
                        terms of peace have been settled and<cb n="6"/> signed. The alliance
                        proposed in substitution- for it, and which it is said the country is
                        resolved upon, cannot be concluded till after the termination of this war,
                        or till after the proclamation of peace. For in the first place the
                        substitution of one alliance for the other would make a belligerent of
                        England at once, were the war still going on; and the next place, until the
                        war is at an end, and until the peace terms demanded and allowed have been
                        settled, the conditions in which we are to undertake a world-policy alliance
                        with Japan must remain in doubt. They may be promising--they may very
                        unpromising; quite possible they may be be,or altogether impossible, and
                        whether they be the one thing or the other is as much out of Eng- land's
                        control as the weather. No doubt it is be- lieved that the war is virtually
                        ended at this moment; and it is also believed that Japan is already in a
                        position to dictate terms of peace. Both are uncertain assumptions. Judging
                        by all that is known, the war is not over, and until it is no one can be
                        sure that it will go on upon an uninterrupted or deflected course. It is
                        true that the Russian preparations for continuing the conflict are
                        explained, plausibly enough, as an expedient for obtaining com- paratively
                        easy terms of peace. It may be so, but yet it may be not; and we should say
                        that another consideration-nowhere re- marked upon at present-ought not to
                        be put out of account. It is possible that the war may remain undetermined
                        for a year to come, or even for two years, without another battle of any
                        consequence. Some military expert will correct us, we hope, if we are wrong.
                        But at present we do not see why the Russians should not withdraw the
                        remains of their army to the Baikal region, perhaps, where the Japanese are
                        most unlikely to follow them, and there prepare for a new campaign when they
                        have another fleet at command. If they have to spend two or three years in
                        such preparation, what of it? They will not have given in. They will not
                        have. sued for peace, as the Japanese Government insists that they shall
                        sue; and although a scheme of retirement like this would look ignominious,
                        absolute submission would look and would be infinitely worse. If the
                        Japanese can afford to follow and still to follow the Russian forces into
                        Siberia, beating them from time to time as they go, there may be les in this
                        expedient than to our ignorance there seems to be. But if not, there is very
                        much less in the Japanese assertion that they will continue the war
                        unceasingly till Russia bows her head to Japan. Another reason for taking
                        this course-sup- posing it possible--is that it disposes for a long spell of
                        time at any rate of the question of indemnity. If the Japanese cannot
                        continue the war upon any ground that the Russian may choose to take up,
                        indemnity cannot be demand- ed, of course; nor is it at all clear at present
                        that the Japanese would be able to enforce payment in any case. To do that
                        it is necessary that Japan should put herself in occupation of some
                        important area of Russian territory-of Russian territory proper; which is,
                        we suppose, pretty much out of the question. And yet to forego the expected
                        indemnity for two or three years without the further crippling of Russia's
                        re- sources and the additional impoverishment of the Russian people, while
                        Japan would still be at a great expense in Manchuria for the main- tenance
                        of garrisons, roads, railways, fortifica- tions, and so forth, would alter
                        the situation very considerably. And with such possibilities as these
                        unsolved, who can say what the end would be, and whether it would be so
                        advan- tageous a thing for England to enter upon the proposed alliance as we
                        imagine? And upon that matter the Continental Govern- ments may have
                        something to say. Considering what the proposition is, what the Japanese
                        openly intend by it, what many among our- selves also intend, it would be
                        strange indeed if the Continental Powers interfered not at all. Our
                        opportunity for completing the alliance would be their opportunity of inter-
                        ference-the peace arrangements, we mean. Can we be sure that they will
                        resign them- selves to take this chance of the new Anglo- Japanese
                        world-policy? Or should. they com- bine to interfere more or less formally,
                        more or less ingeniously or determinately, do we know already how far they
                        will go, or can we count upon their proposals being so little formidable
                        that they may be defied by ourselves and a war-exhausted Japan in
                        combination? We know and can know nothing of this. The only thing that seems
                        quite clear is that Japan ex- pects England to see her through all such
                        difficulties should they arise. The Tokio cor- respondent of the "Times"
                        writes again on behalf of the Japanese anxiety for the new world-policy
                        alliance, but this time with a delicate intimation here and there that if
                        England holds back another ally may be found. No doubt a serious matter. And
                        it may be seen readily enough that the whole of this long letter leads up to
                        the con- cluding paragraph, which is in these terms: "There is, I believe,
                        only one thing that can threaten the stability of the (existing) alliance
                        -namely, the contingency of England's self effacement when the day comes for
                        Japan's settlement with Russia. The alliance has hitherto prevented any
                        third Power from taking part in the conflict. Will it be equally effective

                            and name of the street in which they live indicated on their
                            correspondence. Should by any chance a street be unnamed, then the
                            quarter of the town in which it is situated must be indicated. Attention
                            to these instructions is imperative to avoid delay and errors in the

                    <p>On Thursday evening, L'Eté de St. Martin was given at the Khedivial Opera
                        House. Jean Coquelin was delightful as the irascible- affectionate old uncle
                        proposing to marry his nephew's wife in ignorance of her being married.
                        Adrienne (Mme Morens) has done her best to get on the soft side of the old
                        gentleman, with the natural result. Mme Lebreton (Mme Bouchetal) lets the
                        cat out of the bag, and the uncle explodes with indignation, which quickly
                        subsides under the joint persuasion of niece and nephew, and the curtain
                        falls on a happy ending.</p>
                    <p>Then we had Coquelin Cadet's monologues. The first is startling and a little
                        hard to ex- plain in English. Let us put it this way. The hero has fasted
                        for three months and is lying on the grass awaiting death. A marchioness
                        arrives and is seized with compassion: the sufferer must be saved-but how?
                        Under the circumstances the only thing to do is to supply him with the
                        nourishment provided. by nature for infants, but the charitable sacrifice is
                        in vain for the sufferer expires from indigestion! In the next monologue,
                        Les Medecins, we hear how Providence, after two attempts to destroy mankind,
                        hits upon the creation of doctors as a promising expedient. Pedaliers et
                        Pedalières, a skit on bicyclists, followed, and then we had the fox and crow
                        story in an Englishman's French. After this came Les Romanesques. Coquelin
                        Cadet has very little to do as the picturesque Straforel, "contractor for
                        abductions," but his pleading in the last scene with Sylvette, whom he urges
                        to elope with him, picturing the pleasures of life under the stars or in
                        tents far from civilised men, with occasional cooking for occupation, was a
                        warning to romantic damsels enamoured of the strenuous life. Benjamin (M.
                        Jean Coquelin) and Pasquinot (M. Harment), as the old fathers of the
                        romantic lovers, "brought down the house," and Mme M. Moreno played the part
                        of poetical and fragile lover to perfection. Sylvette (Mlle Manfroy) was
                        charming in every way, and the bravo sufficiently ferocious,</p>

                    <p>The Egyptian Railway Administration has already begun to take action as a
                        result of the recent Railway Commission, and in more ways than one.</p>
                    <p>Orders have been given for the purchase of new rolling stock to the value of

                        this.</p>
                    <p>We have reason to believe that the new rolling stock, or such of it as has
                        arrived, is proving very far from satisfactory. It will be remembered that
                        the order for £30,000 was given to a foreign firm because the English firms
                        could not deliver as quickly as the foreigners, even if they would have
                        accepted the same price and now what is the conse- quence. Some of the new
                        rolling stock will not keep the rails, and it will take some time before
                        this is put right.</p>

                    <p>What with the burning of the Abbas Helmy Theatre, and the sale of the Zizinia
                        and Al- hambra Theatres, Alexandria will probably in the near future remain
                        without a single first- class opera house or theatre, and it is clearly the
                        duty of the Municipality to consider what should be done at the present
                        juncture.</p>
                    <p>A local contemporary has lately been re- viewing all the likely sites in the
                        city that would be suitable for the erection of a new opera house. None of
                        the sites, however, are satisfactory in the opinion of this newspaper, which
                        was right, for it had failed to take into consideration the site of all
                        others the most suitable by reason of its central position, low price, and
                        commanding situation. We refer to the site left vacant by the old Ramleh
                        railway terminus. The chief facade of the theatre would face
                        Ramleh-boulevard and this would give great scope for an architectural
                        triumph, which would confer considerable dis- tinction on the appearance of
                        a rather dull thoroughfare. The elevation of the site would considerably
                        augment the majesty of the build- ing, which would form a fine "coup d'œil"
                        for the new quay-promenade.</p>
                    <p>The site is also convenient in the extreme, as it is close to the most
                        fashionable quarter of Alexandria and very convenient for Ramleh- ites. It
                        could be obtained easily, as the land belongs to the Municipality, and the
                        only parcel of land needed from the Casulli estate could be exchanged for
                        land elsewhere. The chance, in our opinion, is an excellent one and the
                        Municipality will be very foolish to let the opportunity go by.</p>

                    <p>of the Suez Canal Company and a member of its London committee, has
                        resigned.</p>
                    <p>The Suez Canal Company will invite the Chamber of Shipping, which has
                        recently been strongly protesting against the non-representa- tive character
                        of the London committee, to hominate a successor to Mr. Westray on the Suez
                        Canal Board.</p>
                    <p>We understand that the decision of the Company to permit the Council of the

                        caused by the resigna- tion of Mr. J.B. Westray, after many years of useful
                        work, has caused widespread satisfaction. in the City. It is not known on
                        whom the choice of the Chamber will fall, but it is quite certain that the
                        newcomer will stand more for the interests of shipowners than has been the
                        case hitherto. To the recent agitation for a sub- stantial reduction of
                        tonnage dues must be attributed the present more conciliatory attitude of
                        the Canal Company, and it is hoped that May next will witness some
                        lightening of the burden, which has caused so much discontent among
                        shipowners trading to the East.</p>

                        were £1,014,303, as against £982,475 in the previous year. The increase,
                        therefore, in 1905 was £31,828 over 1904.</p>

                        February 17:- Arrangements are being made to welcome Dr. Chauncey Murch of
                        Luxor, Egypt, in Toledo. Marion Lawrance and Rev. Ernest Bourner Allen met
                        him in Cairo when the Sunday school pilgrims were there and they are
                        co-operating with Rev. Albert Gordon, pastor of the United Presbyterian
                        church of this city, in an effort to bring him here. Dr. Murch will be the
                        guest of Dr. Gordon next Sunday morning. He will speak at the United
                        Presbyterian church in the morning, at the Washington Street Sunday school
                        at noon and in the Washington street church in the evening, telling the
                        story of the work in Egypt.</p>

                    <head>GHEZIREH PALACE HOTEL</head>
                    <p>On Thursday, the last small dance of the season was given at Ghezireh Palace,
                        and con- sidering the lateness of the season, it was very animated. For
                        dinner the restaurant was crowd- ed. Amongst the diners we noticed : Lady
                        Mary Leith and party of 8, Mrs. Laing and party of 5, Capt. and Mrs. Nagill
                        and party of 6, Major Rhodes and party of 5, Mrs. Cutman and party of 6,
                        Lady Richards, Mr. and Mrs. McLean, Oberst Isenhart and Rittmeistz Schwerin,
                        Miss Pigeon and Miss Walford entertaining a party of 6, Mrs. Laidlow and
                        party of 5, Mr. Carter Wilson, the Hon. A. and Mrs. Davey, Mr. Hugh Smith,
                        Mr. Hogg and party of 4, Mr. and Mrs. Platt Higgins entertaining 4 guests,
                        Mrs. Irwell, Mrs. Tron- ny and Mrs. O'Brien and party of 4, and many more.
                        Even at midnight, for supper, over 70 people were present. The dance lasted
                        till two o'clock.</p>
                    <p>One of the great attractions of the evening was the garden, where most of the
                        dancers enjoyed a pleasant stroll in the intervals, the night being
                        beautiful.</p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped that next year's season at Ghezireh will be as successful
                        as the present, and we do not doubt but that the management will provide
                        plenty of attractions, as they have done this year.</p>

                    <p>LA REFORME LEGISLATIVE EN EGYPTE</p>
                    <p>"La Revue des Débats" publie à ce sujet une lettre de son correspondant du
                        Caire dont nous eroyons intéressant de donner quelques extraits:</p>
                    <p>Le gouvernement égyptien vient de soumettre à l'approbation des puissances un
                        nou- veau projet de réforme de la législation mixte. A l'article 12 du Code
                        civil mixte, ainsi conçu : "Les additions et modifications aux présentes
                        lois seront édictées sur l'avis conforme du corps de la magistrature, et au
                        besoin sur sa proposition; mais pendant la période quiquen- nale, aucun
                        changement ne devra avoir lieu dans le système adopté", il propose de
                        substituer la disposition suivante: "En cas de silence, de lacunes ou
                        d'obscurité de la loi, il pourra y être pourvu par des dispositions
                        complémen- taires ou interprétatives édictées sur l'initiative du ministère
                        de la justice. Le projet du ministère sera transmis, avec un exposé des
                        motifs, à la Cour, qui s'adressera aux tribunaux de pre- mière instance pour
                        leurs observations, et il pourra être rendu exécutoire par décret khé-
                        divial, à la suite et en conformité d'une délibération de la Cour, prise en
                        assemblée générale, à la majorité des membres présents." En apparence la
                        réforme proposée est anodine; en réalité, la réforme proposée, si elle était
                        adop- tée, constituerait une véritable révolution dans la situation
                        internationale de l'Egypte.</p>
                    <p>De tous les privilèges que les capitulations garantissent aux étrangers en
                        Egypte, le plus précieux est, sans contredit, l'immunité légis- lative. En
                        vertu de ce privilège, les étrangers ne peuvent être soumis aux lois
                        égyptiennes qu'avec l'assentiment exprès des puissances dont ils sont
                        ressortissants. Lorsque, en 1876, les tribunaux mixtes furent institués, le
                        gouvernement égyptien présents à l'approbation des puissances les codes que
                        les nouveaux tribunaux étaient destinés à appliquer, et ces codes n'ont été
                        appliqués par les tribunaux mixtes que dans la mesure où ils avaient été ap
                        prouvés par les puissances. Depuis l'installation des tribunaux mixtes,
                        toutes les modifications à la législation de 1876 ont été faites d'un commun
                        accord entre le gouvernement égyptien et les puissances: et l'approbation
                        des puissances est expressément visée dans les décrets khédiviaux qui ont
                        promulgué ces modifications. De cette coopération directe, le gouvernement
                        égyptien n'a jamais émis la prétention de se passer, et à aucun moment, ni
                        en 1886, ni en 1900, il n'a invoqué la disposition de l'article 12 du Code
                        civil mixte qui, littéralement interprêtée, semblait lui donner le droit
                        d'édicter des lois complémentaires et des lois interprétatives avec le seul
                        assentiment du corps de la magistrature. Un double obstacle s'opposait
                        d'ailleurs à ce que le gouvernement égyptien invoquât cette disposition:
                        d'abord,il n'était pas certain que l'article 12 du Code civil mixte ett
                        force de la loi, pour cette raison que sa disposi tion bien qu'étant d'ordre
                        général, n'avait pas trouvé place dans le Règlement d'organisation
                        judiciaire; ensuite, en admettant que l'arti- cle 12 du Code civil mixte eût
                        force de loi, il résultait des termes très explicites de sa dis- position
                        que celle-ci ne pouvait pas être mise à exécution pendant la période
                        d'essai, laquelle, on le sait, n'a pas encore été déclarée close.-- Le
                        principe de l'immunité législative n'est cependant pas absolu à cette heure.
                        En 1889, les puissances ont consenti une dérogation par- tielle en matière
                        de règlements de police à ce principe et à la règle, qui en est le
                        corollaire, de la coopération directe des puissances à l'action législative
                        de l'Etat Egyptien: il a été convenu que le gouvernement égyptien pourra
                        édicter des règlements de police obligatoires pour les étrangers sans
                        sanction pénale, à la seule condition de provoquer et d'obtenir, avant toute
                        promulgation, une délibération conforme de l'assemblée générale de la Cour
                        d'Alexandrie.</p>
                    <p>C'est une nouvelle dérogation au principe de l'immunité législative que le
                        gouvernement égyptien réclame aujourd'hui ; mais, cette fois, il étend
                        singulièrement ses prétentions. Il ne s'agit plus des règlements de police,
                        il s'agit de toutes les lois:des lois civiles et des lois pénales, des lois
                        de fond et des lois de forme; de la loi en un mot. Oh ! sans doute, le
                        gouvernement égyptien ne revendique pas le plein et entier exercice de la
                        souveraineté législative à l'égard des étrangers; il consent encore, non
                        seulement à prendre l'avis de la Cour d'Alexandrie, mais aussi à restreindre
                        son action législative aux dispositions interprétatives et complémentaires
                        de la législation existante. Mais qui ne voit que cette restriction est plus
                        apparente que réelle, et que, sous prétexte de suppléer au silence de la
                        législation existante ou d'en combler les lacunes, il est bien facile de
                        modifier les principes essentiels de cette législation ? Créer un délit
                        nouveau, c'est suppléer au si- lence de la loi pénale; établir une nouvelle
                        cause de préférence entre les divers créanciers d'un même débiteur, c'est
                        combler une lacune de la loi civile. Le gouvernement égyptien aurait donc le
                        pouvoir, sans l'assentiment exprès des puissances, de soumettre les
                        étrangers à toutes les lois pénales qu'il lui plairait d'édicter et de
                        rendre opposables aux étrangers les privilèges ou les hypothèques légales
                        qu'il jugerait expédient d'établir. Que deviennent, dans ces conditions, et
                        l'immunité législative et les capitulations, et n'avions-nous pas raison de
                        dire que la réforme proposée, si elle était acceptée, constituerait une
                        véritable ré-</p>
