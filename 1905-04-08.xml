                    <head>Local theatre fire</head>
                    <p>The Abbas Ilelrny Theatre at Alexandria was destroyed by fire at an early
                        hour this morning. Yesterday evoning, the usual performance was given by
                        Gatti’s circus troupe,which ended at a quarter past midnight. At 12.20 a.m.
                        the dynamo which supplies the electric light for tho theatre was stupped,
                        and by 12.40 a.m. everyone connected with the theatre had left the building,
                        nothing untoward having hap- pened. At half-past one in the morning,
                        however, the alarm was Jgiven to the Fire Brigade that the “Abbas” was on
                        fire, and on arriving on the spot a few minutes afterwards they found the
                        large building in flames. The fire, which had apparently originated under
                        the stage, had Spread with 'alarming rapidity to the auditorium and boxes,
                        and in a short time the theatre resembled one vast roaring luruace.
                        'Fortunately, no one was in the building at the time; aud there was. no loss
                        of life. 'The horses belonging to the circus troupe were, however, stabled
                        under the stage and efforts were at once directed to saving the, animals.
                        This was done, though three of the horses unfortunately were charred by the
                        flames before they could be got out. v Little or none of the belongings of
                        the unfortunate artistes belonging to the circus troupe cou.d be saved, as
                        the conflagration had got a strong hold of the building. The efforts of the
                        Fire Brigade were mainly directed to saving the walls of the theatre and the
                        sur- rounding buildings, and it reflects great credit ou them that the lire
                        was so successfufly kept wiihiu hounds, none of the adjacent buildings being
                        affected. Bhortly after the outbreak the toot of the building collapsed with
                        a tremen- dous crash, aud now nothing remains of the theatre but ‘the four
                        walls, the whole place being entirely gutted. By 5 o’clock tms morning the
                        fire was thoroughly mastered by tne Brigade, but the hremeh are still
                        engaged in pumping water ou the smouldering mass ol charred wood- work and
                        distorted iron pillars. The cause of the outbreak has not as yet been
                        ascertained, and the sympathies of all .will be with the proprietors,

                        by insurance. Thp theatre was built in 1834 aud was valued at something like
                        £16,0011.</p>

                    <p>The Procnreur General thus oonolndes his review of crime:— That the inorease
                        in orime, properly so called,' is less by half in 1904 than in; 1903, while
                        criminal robbery has not risen (it has in fact fallen by 20)—that the rise
                        in dMits is small in comparison with that of the last years, and no more
                        than what might be fairly expected ; that such increase as there is
                        accounted for by petty oases of assault and by a more -exacting standard in
                        the Matter of false accusations while theft and crop-destroying have
                        decreased, and cattle-poisoning not in- creased ; all this, while it oannot
                        be oalled a brilliant result, at least indicates a less marked tendency of
                        serious orime to remain on the increase, and is, so far, a matter for

                    <p>The state of things, at present, is far from encouraging, and it is not
                        astonishing that native reformers should be at length awaken- ing to the
                        urgent necessity of serious re- forms in these Courts. Notably, in suits
                        concerning private Wakfs, scarcely a week passes without some more or less
                        serious com- plaint being received at this Ministry. The majority ol these
                        private Wakf suits are pure questions of property and private rights and do
                        not in any way affeot the religion of the people. Some of the more
                        enlightened among native reformers therefore consider that the wisest and
                        most satisfactory solution for all concerned would be for the Mehkamehs to
                        hand overfall that relates to private Wakfs (Wakfs Ahly) to the Native
                        Tribunals, retain- ing their competence in charitable Wakfs only (Wakts
                        Khairy) which, being, of a more spiritual nature, fall mbre properly within
                        the jurisdiction of religious Courts. This would certainly be a solution of
                        the difficulty and itt> leasibihty is under the consideration of the
                        Government. r </p>
                    <p>There has been some attempt, in quarters hostile to the project* _ to make
                        capital out of the case of Mr. 'Beck and the stinHulus which that deplorable
                        affair has given in England to a revival ol the agitation for a Court of
                        Criminal Appeal. It may therefore perhaps be desirable to say a lew words on
                        this subject. The suggestion is, of course, that the Egyp- tian'Goverument
                        is proposing to abolish tlyi very safeguard which that case has shown to‘be
                        imperatively necessary. Two considerations suffice to demonstrate -the
                        fallacy iff this con- tention. The .first is that there is no real analogy
                        between the functions of the Egyptian Court of Criminal Appeal—which it is
                        proposed to suppress -here^—and those of the English Court ot Criminal
                        Appeal—which it is desired to introduce at home. The one reviews, on the
                        papers, jthe findings of (act of Tribunals which have heard the witnesses;
                        the other would eitheT rehear the case de novo, witnesses and all, or else
                        order anew trial at which the witnesses would be reheard. Whatever ad-
                        vantages, therelore, might attach to the latter sj8tem—>they are highly
                        problematical, the question being, as is generally admitted, an exceedingly
                        controversial one—they are clearly not poMeased by the Egyptian institution
                        which only exceptionally hears the witnesses. The secoud consideration is
                        that the learned Commissioners appointed to iuquire into the Beck case, and
                        report thereon to-the Home Becretary, have not, as a matter of fact, seeu
                        fit to recommend the institution of a Court of Criminal Appeal, which they
                        apparently regard —aud, it is submitted, rightly (1)—as calculat- ed to
                        impair the dignity aud finality of the stti unices of the existing Criminal
                        Courts. They content themselves with reoommending that some machinery should
                        be provided for secur* ing the possible oousidcration, by a superior Court,
                        of crucial poiuts of law decided by the judge at the trial. Such machinery
                        already exists, in the Egyptian system, in the powers of the Court of
                        Cassation, before which any oonvicted person has the faculty of showiug that
                        a point of law bas beeu erroneously decided, to his disadvantage, and that
                        he has consequently not had a fair trial, or that his oonviction is bad in
                        law. If he suoceeds, the Court of Cassation either quashes the conviction or
                        orders a new trial. We may, therefore, dismiss the idea that, the Beck case
                        has any real bearing on the question of Assize Courts for Egypt. The qnes
                        tiou remains yrhether, in any other respect, the situation has undergone any
                        change since last year. Unfortunately it would appear that, it there has
                        been any change, it has been tor the worse, crime having again increased, as
                        may be seen from the report of the Procnreur General, though not, I am glad
                        to say, in the same ratio as in the preceding year.</p>

                    <p>After citing various oases to prove the defective drafting o * the Egyptian
                        Civil Code, the Judioial Advisei remarks :— But it is not only in the
                        drafting that Egyp- tian legislation is defective but also in the total
                        omission of a number of important subjects and the locume and obscurities in
                        the provisions regarding others. Thus Egyptian legislation contains no law
                        of copyright, no law ef patents, no )»w of trade mark* and Egypt has
                        conssqueitly been unable to adhere to the various International Conventions
                        relat- ing to these most important subjects. There are constant compla inta
                        from the commercial communities as to he loss and inoonvenienoe caused to
                        them by the absence of a satisfactory law on these questions of every-day
                        applica- tion. Again, the lan i law is very defective. The law of easements
                        {servitudes) is so brief and incomplete as to givi i rise to constant
                        difficulties. Wakfs aqd contracts of a similar nature are governed
                        exolusivsly by Mohamedan law, which varies according to the different rite*
                        not to mention the divergences in the views of the various authorities of
                        the same rite. Obviously the only remedy for a body of legis- lation so
                        radically defeotive is to simplify the modus legiferendi in Egypt. That the
                        Egyptian Government should be oompelled to apply to fourteen Powers whenever
                        it is desired- to efieot an improvement in Codes of the oalibre above
                        described or to provide legislation cm subjects of the importance above
                        referred to is obviously absurd</p>

                    <p>In regard to the provisions of the above project, the Judicial Adviser
                        remarks: “It would undoubtedly effect a very considerable change in the
                        existing system and there can be very little doubt that the change would
                        prove beneficial to the community at large. Indeed the defects of the
                        present system are almost universally recognised and its continued existence
                        is mainly due to the circumstance that it has hitherto proved impossible to
                        formulate an acceptable’ scheme ’ to take its place. Now, howeve^ that such
                        a scheme Jras been voted by a majority of the technical delegates, it is
                        greatly to be hoped that political considerations may not induce the Powers
                        to vhto the projeot and deprive Egypt of the benefits of a reform for whioh
                        she has been struggling for so many years.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday the troopship “Dilwara” left Southampton with artillery and
                        infantry drafts and various details on board for Gibraltar and Malta.
                        Amongst the officers is Major C. L. E. Eustace-Robertson, D.S.O., King’s
                        Royal Rifle Corps, who joins the 1st Battalion at Cairo. The “Dilwara” is
                        due at Malta on the 2nd April and at Southampton on the 11th follow- ing.
                        Her return will dose the trooping season of 1904-03. Captain Claude 3.
                        Hawker, Coldstream Guard* commanding the Camel Corps of the Egyptian Army,
                        has just been promoted to field rank in the Guards. Major Hawker entered the
                        Guards close on fifteen years ago, the last six of which hare been spent in
                        the Khedivefa service. He earned' tile Egyptian medal with clasps for the
                        operations against the Khalifa in 1899, shortly after he joined the Egyptian
                        Army. .A Captain S. J. Somerville, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, attached
                        lately to the Indian Army, has been restored to the establishment of the
                        inniskillings vice Captain R. C. Piero* appoint- ed adjutant of the 8rd
                        Battalion. A feeling has been created that the War Office is trying to
                        conceal the names of the fraudulent contractors in connection with the Cape
                        Stores scandal. On the other hand, Mr. Arnold-Forster has given all the
                        knowledge he possessed on the matter. There is every reason to believe that
                        every difficulty was put in the way of his doing so. The battleship "London”
                        (Captain Philip F. Tillard), which was commissioned at Ports- mouth on the
                        7th Juu* 1902, for service with the Mediterranean Fleet; will return home
                        from that station on 24th prox. She will pay off the following day at
                        Portsmouth, and will be recommissioned for another tour of service in
                        Mediterranean waters. Her crew will be partially drawn from the battleship
