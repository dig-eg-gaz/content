                    <head>The Financial Stringency in Egypt</head>
                    <p>The scarcity of gold which again made itself felt last month was not nearly
                        so acute as that experienced a few weeks previously, but, on the other hand,
                        was much more unexpected. An insufficency of gold for currency requirements
                        is no new phenomenon in this country and will, undoubtedly, continue to
                        occur from time to time owing to the fact that any sudden and unexpected
                        demand for gold can only be met by fresh inmports from Europe. The position
                        in October was declared by people who know the country well as being the
                        worst for many years, and the general opinion was that, after the heavy
                        importations of gold, a similar situation could not possibly occur again
                        this season. Events have proved the inaccuracy of these opinions, for during
                        December there was a renewed gold famine, much less acute than its predessor
                        it is true, but which at the same time made itself somewhat severely felt,
                        as the exchange quotations show. On Saturday the 1st December banks' buying
                        price of cheque on London was quoted at 97 to 97 whilst on the following
                        Monday it went down to 97 and later in the week to 96 the average of the
                        month being a shade under 97. Although other instances might be quoted, we
                        will content to ourselves by mentioning merely the case of a certain native
                        who, at the present moment, is reputed to have I.E. 20,000 (20,512) in
                        National Bank of Egypt notes hidden in his house in one of the villages. The

                    <p>( FROM OUR THEATRICAL CORRESPONDENT: )</p>
                    <p>"La Fille du Regiment" is as distinot a change as possible after two tew
                        Mazgènets, Meyerbeer, and the other productions we have had so far. It is
                        rather a delightful change, too; charming light must be known, and plenty of
                        dialogue and acting. Mlle Charpentier and M. Darand (the sergeant) were
                        quite good, always correct and with plenty of life as far as singing went;
                        and they acted extremely well, better than they sang, I confess: Mlle Char,
                        pentier looked enchantingly pretty, more so in her fashionable dress if
                        possible that as the Vivandière ; and the sergeant was finely made up. M.
                        Monteox had the part of Topio, and for once be sang in tone, but his voice
                        is most distasteful, hopelessly affected, and entirely falsetto in the high
                        notes.</p>
                    <p>The chorus were much as usual, but why do they look so deplorably stolid !
                        And do all French soldiers of the period wear those quaint American-striped
                        trousers ? I rather wished they would black their faces and try a "coon"
                        song. An elaborate ballet Wowed the opera, I confess I only ondored of it. I
                        don't profess to understand ballet. It seemed except for Mlle Deliny, to
                        consist in a species of swimming lessons--at least as far as the arms were
                        concerned. Doubtless every gesture has its cabalistio meaning for the
                        initiated. The music, by one Délibes, was rather pretty, with plenty of
                        violine, floter, and French bora (which made one think of togs from
                        Wagnerand that was nice).</p>
                    <p>With regard to fortbooming performances, "L'Afriesine" and "Messaline" are
                        being "studied". I asked about places. That is always a ground of complaint
                        for those who do not buy seats for the season, and who really want to hear
                        opera, and not their neighbours' opinions on Bourse questions. Seats on
                        Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday are practically unobtainable, but on
                        Fridays there are plenty as the abonnement is only partial. When will the
                        worthy managers understand that the whole reality of the opera and theatre
                        is annihilated by that absurd "abonnement" system! It has no single saving
                        merit: even the regularity of the receipts is fatal to the acting and
                        singing, as no real effort or risk is involved : an empty house represents
                        as much money-and far less noise-than a full house. That is perhaps a merit
                        to a few keen listeners.</p>

                    <head>ZIZINIA THEATRE.</head>
                    <p>The opera season at the above theatre, thus far, has proved one of the best
                        for several years. Each production has been well staged, and the artistes
                        concerned are, for the most part, evenly balanced, --a very great assistance
                        to the general success of any theatrical representation, whether dramatic or
                        operatie. Saturday's performance of "Mefistofele" was certainly the most
                        perfect of this opera. Signor Carlo Walter was in fine form, and his
                        splendid voice was heard to great advantage. Sigoor Walter's histrioni
                        ability is well known, but his Mephisto undoubtedly one of his best, and at
                        the same time one of the most difficult roles. His impersonation is worthy
                        of more than a passing comment, showing, as it does, most careful study,
                        &amp; commendable attention to the minutest detaile, a perfect picture of
                        devilry and music, -a strange combination, perhaps, but one necessary in the
                        present instances; in fine, an artistio performance worthy of Signor
                        Walter.</p>
                    <p>Signor Agerbi as Paust appeared tired, and sang occasionally rather out of
                        tune. His performance, however, was an excellent one Signora De Lerms was in
                        perfect voice and sang admirably throughout the opera. We preferred her
                        appearance in the second part as a brunette; why do the powers that be
                        insist on a blonde Marguerite?</p>
                    <p>The other characters were well supported, and the orchestra worked
                        splendidly. By the way, can nothing be done to prevent the discordant
                        tootling and scraping indalgel in by the orchestra before each act ? Such
                        noises cannot be intended for tuning, and they most jar on the sensitive
                        ears of many patrons of the theatre.</p>

                    <p>MR. ROBERTSON VISITS DENISHWAI.</p>
                    <p>Mr. J. M. Robertson, M.P., has been touring in the Gharbieh province. On
                        Saturday night the M.P. was entertained by the Omdeb of Borwah. Our Shebin
                        el Kom Correspondent, telegraphing this morning, says :- Rumours are current
                        here that Mr. Robertson, M.P., paid a visit to the village of Denishwai
                        yesterday. He has also visited this town.</p>
                    <p>The journeys of Mr. Robertson are being followed with great interest by the
                        Nationalist Press, and with such detail that one might imagine that this
                        gentleman was being escorted throughout Egypt by a phalanx of Nationalist
                        journalists.</p>
                    <p>"Al Ahram" remarks: We are glad to see that Mr. Robertson is engaged in
                        inspecting many native localities and departments and taking down in his
                        note-book all that he can gather of the circumstances of the natives. This
                        may be useful to this country later on. We have been informed that this
                        member of Parliament refused to see some AngloEgyptian Government officials
                        and refrained from seeing some other persons, whose object was only to serve
                        the interests of the Occupation.</p>
                    <p>"Al Watan," the Coptic organ, remarks :The Islamic newepaper world has
                        welcomed Mr. J. MR bertson, M.P., with such enthusiasm that some of our
                        contemporaries seemed on the point of hailing him as the deliverer of Egypt
                        and the defender of Islam. Yet this gentleman's views are utterly divergent
                        from the native way of thinking. Mr. Robertson's friends in Egypt are
                        persons in favour of religious instructior, while he is well known to be
                        antagonistic to all creeds. He was a friend of Bradlaugh, the notorious
                        Atheist, and he assisted him in editing a journal whose object was the
                        promotion of Free Thought. He is one of the members of the committee of the
                        Rationalist Press Association together with Hoxley, Tyndall, and Haeckel,
                        who are among those European savants who deny revealed religion. He is the
                        author of many works dealing with liberty of thought, i.e., the denial of
                        taith and the fictions of religious peoples' belief. Yet the leaders of
                        Islam in Egypt have nevertheless chosen Mr. Robertson, of all people in the
                        world, as their sincere friend, for they consider him as the man with the
                        truest ideas! Is not this a carious anomaly? </p>
                    <p>"Al Lewa," of yesterday's date, gives the following account of Mr.
                        Robertson's progress in the provinces :-</p>
                    <p>News comes from the Bebera that Mr. J. "M. Robertson one of the commissions
                        composed of Liberal members of the British Parliament who are studying the
                        condition of Egypt, arrived at Itay-el-Baroud on Friday, where he was
                        welcomed by a number of omdehs and notables of the Mondirieh who happened to
                        be gathered at the station. The Markaz Mamoar introduced the best known
                        among them to Mr. Robertson, who shook hands with the natives and expressed
                        pleasure at meeting them. His object in coming, he said was to travel
                        through the provinces and study the manner of living of the fellaheen. Mr.
                        Robertson, who was accompanied by Abd ElHamid Ammar, proceeded to Nahiel
                        Biban, where he was received as a guest by the Ammar family. The natives
                        evince their I pleasure at seeing Mr. Robertson, knowing the object he has
                        in view.</p>

                        throughout, made a fine ron ap the ground, and Mr. Spier, bo!ding the

                        last, and scored a clever goal, bringing the score to 2 to 1 in favour of

                        match. This naturally added extra interest to the game. From the throw-in
                        Mr. Jenkinson came away, bat missed his shot, and some give-and take in the
                        middle of the ground followed. In the second chokker the play was keener and
                        faster than ever, Mr. Jenkinson doing great work for his side, bat be missed
                        an easy goal. We noticed a good deal of missing on both sides, but the
                        keenness of all the players made up for this. It was not until the fourth
                        and last chukker that Mr. Beckwith scored a goal for the Guards. This pat K.

                        the K. 8. C. Bat the Guards were not done with, and made a most determined
                        attack on the goal of the K. 8. C., who, after saving their goal several
                        times, were at last besten in their detence. This brought the soore to 2

                        The Guards, who evidently were still fall of fight, soon settled matters, a
                        good run up the ground resulting in a goal. Final scores : Tigers, 2 goals ;
                        Coldstream Guards, 3 goals.</p>

                <p>PREJUDICIAL TO NATIONAL SECURITY!</p>
                <p>London, January 12. The "Daily Telegraph '' states that there is reason to
                    believe that the Committee of Imperial Defence, at its last meeting, decided
                    that the construction of a Channel Tunnel would be prejudicial to national
                    security. (Reuter)</p>

                    Assert that Mr. Birrell only accepted the post after the names of other Cabinet

                    called Morocco only as ad latus to Major Tschadi and as such his duties will be
                    to assist tha Major in his office of Chief Engineer to the Sultan. Lieutenant
                    Wolff will also find employment in the personal service of the Saltan and will
                    perhaps have some connection with the cavalry. He is an excellent polo player, a
                    game that the Sultan is very fond of. The statement that Lieut. Wolff is going
                    to Morocco as cavalry instructor is untrue. He has nothing whatever to do with

                    <p>London, January 4.</p>
                    <p>The Money Market. </p>
                    <p>The fall in the value of money which we stated last week would probably occur
                        in January has rapidly taken place. At the end of the year 6 percent was
                        freely paid, but today money is not easy to employ at 4 percent, and for a
                        time at least it promises to range between 3 and 4 per cent. We have already
                        warned our readers that this sudden cheapness of money is not likely to be
                        permanent, in consequence of the demsado from many quarters, where great
                        developments are in progress. If, as appears likely, cheap money continue,
                        at any rare for a short time, the opportunity is not likely to be lost by
                        those who have new issues ready, and are only waiting a favourable moment to
                        launch them on the public.Therefore it is that they may come in a rush and
                        make the period of ease still shorter. The public are not open-mouthed just
                        now, however, and any new enterprise is likely to meet with due orificism,
                        but there is no reason to doubt that first-rate companies would have a good
                        chance. Although gold is not plenty," as the Americans put it, there is
                        money to invest, but the many shrinkages of the last five years have made it
                        all very shy and cautious.</p>
                    <p>The Bank of England statement this week shows a very marked improvement, both
                        on the previous week and on 1906. The reserve has risen £969,363, which is
                        an increase on last year of no less than £1 839 543; so that there is no
                        ground for any apprehension in the immediate future, so loud as the
                        conservative policy is porened, and the Bank rate is not prematurely
                        lowered. </p>
                    <p>The Stock Markets.</p>
                    <p>It is rather early to give an opinion regarding the probable course of the
                        stock markets during 1907, but there is no reason to be disappointed with
                        the movements so far. The opening on Wednesdıy -the "House" was. closed on -
                        New Year's Day- was very satisfactory, and those energetic members who
                        contented themselves with the single day's holiday on Tuesday, and commenced
                        the year at business, had no reason to regret doing so.</p>
                    <p>Of course, a very important factor inducing to the improved tone was the
                        easing of the monetary position. At the Control settlement the contango was
                        much easier than a month ago, being proud about 51 percent, hence the effect
                        on gilt-edged stock: was very marked. This good influence extended to most
                        other departments, home railways being especially brisk.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday, with the exception of gilt-edged securities, there was some
                        falling away from the good position assumed at the opening, due, no dogbt,
                        to an extent to profit : taking, and to-day markets opened dullish. This
                        afternoon, bowover, the tone has been better in most sections, though only
                        restricted business: has been done.</p>
                    <p>As to the future, the monetary position will, of course, play an important
                        part, bot, as we have said before, the present 6 por cont, offi :ial minimum
                        is likely to continue in for cu for some time to come, and a general
                        recognition of this probability will be helpful to those who are relying
                        upon a reduced rate to bring a revival in stock and share dealing.</p>
                    <p>Consols.</p>
                    <p>The gilt-edged market has been very favourably affected by the ending of the
                        money position, and there is vestment in advance of a portion of the Control
                        dividende shortly to be distributed. On Wednesday Capsules advanced 2%, and
                        yesterday at the close they were higher cash at 83, the price for the
                        account being to better at 85 after being as high as 87. The closing
                        quotations to night for cash and account are 86 and 87. </p>
                    <p>Foreign Bonds.</p>
                    <p>The foreign market opened firm, the strength of Russia being a notable
                        feature. The Fours and the new Fives, each advanced to 78 and 2 discounts.

                    <p>"There has been a great deal of uneasiness in New York regarding the monetary

                        prices well above parity, New York advices caused a set-back. Yesterday the

                        in the day the tone again weakened, Unions losing 1 to 184 up Southern

                    <p>For the greater part of the week there has been little movement in the
                        Egyptian market, owing to the celebration of the Christmas holidays in
                        Egypt, and prices have in the main been nominal. It is satisfactory to note
                        that now, however, the tendency is much improved, and the outlook is

                    <head>PROSPECTUS. </head>
                    <p>THE COMPANY has been formed for the purposes stated in the Memorandum of
                        Association, and more particularly to establish a line of British steamships
                        to supply the demand made by the increasing passenger traffic for a first
                        class and rapid service between Europe and Egypt</p>
                    <p>The Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Limited, of Glasgow, has
                        contracted with the Company for the construction of two turbine steamers of
                        about 13,000, tons gross register, the length of the vessels to be 550 feet
                        and breadth 60 feet. The steamers will each have five turbines, viz: —three
                        turbines for going ahead and two for going astern. They will each have three
                        propellers and (according to specification) are to steam no less than 201
                        knots an hour, at which speed the passage between Marseilles and Alexandria
                        should be accomplished in 70 hours. Accommodation will be provided for 500
                        first class and 280 second class passengers.</p>
                    <p>In preparing the specification for their steamers, the Directors have had in
                        view the recent great advances that have been made in the fitting of
                        steamers with the object of easing the outfort of passengers. Besides
                        state-room accommodation of the most up to date character, a number of
                        "cabineta de loxe," each with private bathroom, etc., adjoining will be
                        provided, and in addition to the usual public room there will be on the
                        upper deck a restaurant (having separate kitchens and service) in which
                        meals will be served at all hours à la carte.</p>
                    <p>In view of the ports, Matreilles' ' and Alex andria, at which the steamers
                        will call, special attention has been paid to ventilation. This will be
                        affected by the thermotank system by which the air in every part of the
                        ships will be changed six times an hour. Other features will be a children's
                        salon and passenger lift communicating with the various passenger decks. I
                        will be seen that the Company's steamer will reproduce all the most striking
                        features.</p>

                        has taken place during the last few years in the passenger traffic between
                        Egypt and Europe. In 1902, 60,000, and in 1903. 171,000 passengers
                        disembarked at Port Said and Alexandria. I. 1904 the total number was
                        90,410. In 1905 it rose to 99,922. These figures are exclusive to troops,
                        but include all classes of passengers." </p>
                    <p>The Directors believe that the special facilities which the Company's service
                        will provide will appeal to the largely increasing travelling public and
                        will also prove highly remunerative.</p>
                    <p>The contract price for the above-mentioned steamers is £6 6,000 payable in
                        the nanal method by instalmente, whereof £106,000 is payable during
                        contraction, leaving £400,000 payable on delivery of the steamers or at the
                        option of the Company by instalments extending over two years. </p>
                    <p>The Directors will in any event go to allotment, having regard to the fact
                        that the following persons have applied for 40,000 ordinary and 40,000
