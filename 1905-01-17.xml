                    <head>THE OUTLOOK.</head>
                    <p>It is necessary to notice an opinion which is being voiced in certain
                        prominent quarters that the fall of the great Russian fortress affords Japan
                        an opportunity to offer terms of peace that would put an end to the
                        struggle. The Mikado is accused of losing a great opportunity, and it is
                        even suggested that Great Britain should urge her ally to "moderation."
                        However humane, this is a wholly narrow and mistaken view of the great
                        issues at stake. Japan has taken up arms to preserve vital national
                        interests involved in the absolute integrity of the three</p>

                        Korea as well; while, on the other hand, Russia would regard as a "shameful
                        peace" any sacrifice of those vast pretensions which have already
                        materialised in that great artery of aggression, the Chinese Eastern
                        Railway, and the garrisons planted by her in all the principal towns and
                        commercial centres of Manchuria.</p>
                    <p>When, therefore, people talk of Japan moderating her aims, it is tantamount
                        to saying that Russia, by walking into her neighbour's vineyard, has thereby
                        actually acquired certain vested rights, and that Japan should "now be
                        satisfied with something less than those objects for which she has incurred
                        a vast expenditure of blood and treasure, objects in which the whole of
                        Anglo-Saxondom is as closely concorned as Japan herself. Whatever wisdom
                        there may have seemed in compromise this time last year, its possibility and
                        its necessity from Japan's point of view, after eleven months of constant
                        victory over the Russian armies and the capture of the enemy's chief
                        stronghold, have passed away. Japan was never so powerful, both by land and
                        sea, never more justified in looking for the final success of her efforts,
                        than she is at the present moment.</p>
                    <p>But the Government of the Mikado, while exhibiting a spirit of the highest
                        generosity towards its beaten foes, is displaying a good deal of
                        business-like resolution as well, and it is morally certain that the release
                        of their forces from the Kwangtung peninsula will initiate a new era of
                        activity on the Shaho. Kuropatkin has evidenced his weakness and lack of
                        confidence in failing to attack his enemy while Stoessel was continuing his
                        diversion at Port Arthur. His chances are now infinitely reduced by the
                        unchaining of General Nogi, so that unless once more urged on by the
                        desperate gamblers of St. Petersburg, he is not likely to make the first
                        move.</p>
                    <p>A telegram we publish to-day from Mukden shows that Oyama does not intend to
                        delay any longer and has begun bombarding the Russian positions. The weather
                        is propitious and the next two months must be taken advantage of, for in
                        April the great spring melting begins, when the whole country breaks up into
                        bog, closely followed, after a short period of baking, by the heavy rains of
                        July. The most interesting consideration, therefore, in any event, whether
                        Kuropatkin is forced to a fresh southward effort or Oyama opens the ball, is
                        the probable direction of the Japanese blow. The fronts of the two armies
                        are so heavily protected that we must look to the flanks for the solution of
                        the present situation.The great danger for the Russian army is a Japanese
                        success upon its right flank, which would endanger its means of escape. It
                        is to the west of this that a considerable force under General Prince
                        Fushima has long been posted in readiness to break in upon the Russian line
                        of communications and retreat, and if is more than probable that the heavy
                        reinforcement of this body into an effective striking force will form a
                        salient feature of Oyama's next movement, Kuropatkin cannot remain where he
                        is much longer. His enemy's strength in every respect is growing much faster
                        than his, and he must either stake all on a desperate effort to a victory,
                        or make good his retreat to Harbin or Tieling. This would undoubtedly be his
                        wisest course, but it would seem as though the same unwillingness to make
                        such an acknowledgment of impotence were operating alike to prevent the
                        recall of Rojdestvensky, and the escape of Kuropatkin from the increasing
                        perils of bis position. </p>

                            protested that the position was being thrown away. It is evident from
                            the stores that the surrender was unnecessary, and that the fortress
                            could have held out for months longer, 25,000 troops being able and
                            willing to fight. General Stoessel is now much blamed for the
                            disgraceful conclusion of a splendid defence, which practically ended
                            with the death of General Kondracaenko. (Reuter.)</p></div>

                        Mace," who is really Lieut. de Vaisseau )f the French Navy. The yacht
                        preceded the first fleet to Djibouti or the purpose of making arrangements
                        for their coaling and provisioning. She returned here with a large number of

                        Theatre deserves some mention. Signora Svicher and Signor Tomisaniboth were
                        to sing, and therefore the house was full, and the public's confidence was
                        indeed amply repaid. Siguora Svicher has never been in better voice, to our
                        thinking : not only did she perform the usual astonishing feats of vocal
                        dexterity, but all the more 'ordinary' (shall we call it ?) part of her idle
                        was given with exceptional delicacy and exactness of note. She also gave
                        between the 2nd and 3rd acts a truly delightful rendering the aria from
                        Rigoletto, and the close was marked by an exceptional high note. She well
                        deserved the gorgeous collection of bouquets and presents, to bring in which
                        the services of at least half the staff were needed. Signor Tomisani was
                        perhaps rather unfortunate in that his great song is in the last act,
                        wherein the soprano does not appear. He sang with all that rare and
                        exquisite tone which is so marked a feature in his voice. Signor Baldini was
                        also very good. We shall have every reason to regret the departure of this
                        company, and we hope that the improved attendance during the letter part of
                        their stay may induce them to pay Cairo another visit next year.</p>

                    <p>A few days ago, while the Dutch petroleum tank steamer. "Sultan Van Koetei"
                        was coming out of the Canal, a native dhow laden with flour in bags and
                        petroleum in cases, having about 30 passengers bound for Tor, was in the
                        steamer's course between the buoys. The vessel, not being able to alter her
                        . cqurse in the Canal, blew her whistle several times, so ithat the dhow
                        might clear the way. Instead of this, however, she attempted to cross,
                        thinking there would be ample time to do so. Unfortunately the S.S. "Sultan
                        Van Koetei" did not take long to run into the dhow, making a large hole
                        amidships, and in a few minutes the craft went to the bottom.</p>
                    <p>The passengers and crew, however, managed to keep afloat till assistance
                        reached them, with the exception of one Bedouin passenger who was drowned.

                        the party went on «board to welcome the Prince, being presented by Mr.
                        Belinfantp--Ostberg. His Royal .Highness shook -hands cordially with * all
                        and was. graciously .pleasedto accept a bouquet of violets from Mrs.

                    <p>Shortly afterwards Prince i Gustavus Adolfos, accompanied.by his suite, Baron
                        de Ralamb and Col. Suerre, landed and was saluted bya guard of honour
                        composed of Customs Guards, under Bimbashi Paling. His Royal Highness drove
                        off in Mr. Henry Barker's carriage, accompanied by Mr. Belinfante-Ostberg
                        and his suite, and went to Mr. Barker's residence, where he partook of tea.
                        H.R.H. afterwards travelled to Cairo in the Khedive's saloqn carriage,
                        leaving Moharrem -Bey station at 4.25 p.m. On arrival at Cairo the Royal
                        visitor proceeded to Shepheard's Hotel, where he will reside for some

                    <p>The other passengers of the "Hohenzollem" left by a special train chartered,
                        by the agent of the company at 5.80 p.m.In regard to the grounding of the
                        "Hohep-zollero," our enquiries tend to show that the fortunately, small
                        mishap was due to the pilot of the vessel having given the wrong signal and
                        therefore no blame can be attached to Captain Plosch. </p>

                    <p>A correspondent writes :—In view of th&lt; scandals of the Belgian
                        administration of the congo Free State, and of the way the Belgians exercise
                        an absolute monopoly over the track .of that vast country, would it not be
                        justifiable to resort to retaliatory measures in Egypt in view of the unfair
                        treatment that is meted out to British traders in the. Free. (?).State ?</p>
                    <p>Nothing could more effectively bring the[Belgian Government to reason and
                        compel.it to. reverse its methods, than a stern but salutary lesson
                        administered in &amp; country like this, where Belgian interests axe not
                        inconsiderable and show every sign of benefiting by the general improvements
                        brought about by British rule. The Germans have, a saying, "Wie du mir, so
                        ich dir." Many Belgians, I believe, understand German* What would they say
                        to the application of that proverb to them their British victims. But there
                        is little hope that the British Government will abandon its present policy
                        of timid forbearance. </p>

                    <p>Mer expose que M. De Bono,'Conser vateur des hypothèques du Tribunal d'Alex
                        andrie, possèoe 300 feddans de terrains qu'il a achetés de Boghos Achikian,
                        lequel les tenait par concession en règle, du Gouvernement. Un beau jour un
                        bedouin .de la localité, nomme Abdel Hamid, qui n'avait pour toute fortune
                        qu'une tente, se met à vendre à M. Eynaud un lot de 1,300 feddans, parmi
                        lesquels se trouvait la parcelle de M. De Bono. Il faut savoir qu'Abdel
                        Hamid était le gardien et le locataire par amodiation des terres de M. De
                        Bono. Le 17 avril 1902, celui-ci lance une citation à M. Eynaud qui s'étail
                        installé furtivement sur ses terrains et y avait détruit des bornes en fer
                        et creusé des masrafs. Une enquête avec expertise fut ordonnée s sitôt pat
                        le Tribunal.Me Cuzzer fait ressortir à . la barre que la preuve faite au
                        moyen de bédouins appartenant à la tribu duvendeur ne peut être prise on
                        considération, s'agissant en la circonstance de témoins complaisants. Il
                        critique ensuite le rapport de l'expert qui, en dressant son plan, a pris un
                        faux point de départ. Un autre expert, dans une affaire identique, Karam
                        contre Eynaud, s'était basé sur l'application des titres originaires, tandis
                        que dans le procès actuel, l'expert n'a tenu aucun compte du hodjet délivré
                        a M. De Bono. Me Cuzzer s'étend ensuite.sur la question de la propriété, il
                        soutient qu'un bédouin nomade ne peut pas prescrire au Mariout, que de plus
                        pour que la propriété soit effective il faut quelle s'exerce d'une façon
                        évidente et publique. et que le propriétaire paie l'impôt. </p>
                    <p>Me de La Pommeraye,pour M.Eynaud,soutient que M. De Bono ne connaît pas la

                    <p>FRANCILLON</p>
                    <p>Francillon est une délicieuse petite comédie, la meilleure pénétré des
                        productions d'Alex-dre Dumas fils. L'action en est rapide, le style alerte
                        et spirituel ; l'effet, qui n'y est pas recherché, n'en est que plus
                        sûr.Francillon, la femme de Lucien de Riverolles, aime uniquement. son mari,
                        mais, justement jalouse, elle l'avertit que s'il la trompe elle le trompera
                        aussi. Lucien, c'est le mari insignifiant qui aime sa. femme, mais qui n'en
                        continue pas moins à fréquenter son ancienne maîtresse. Ihn soir qu'il va la
                        rejoindre au bal de l'opéra, il est suivi par sa femme qui, pour se venger,
                        se fait conduire par un inconnu à la Maison d'Or. Le lendemain elle raconte
                        tout à son mari et lui fait croire qu'elle est allée Jusqu'au bout.
                        La-dessus fureur de Lucien qui d'ailleurs ne sait à quoi se résoudre et
                        demande conseil à tout le monde. Survient le clerc du notaire, appelé pour
                        établir l'état respectif de leurs fortunes. Francillon reconnaît en lui son
                        cavalier de l'autre nuit. Le mari soumet celui-ci à un interrogatoire qui,
                        en somme, ne peut rien éclaircir. C'est l'amie de Francillon, restée seule
                        avec elle, qui finit par découvrir la vérité. L'amie luiditque l'inconnu
                        s'est vanté de l'avoir possédée. Francillon jette alors un cri éperdu "Il en
                        a menti !" qui proclame son innocence. </p>
                    <p>Serveille. M. Paul Plan a été insignifiant à souhait dans son rôle de Lucien
                        de Riverolles. Sa voix souple et agréable, la perfection de sa diction, son
                        aspect imposant en font un acteur de premier ordre. Il a merveilleusement su
                        s'adapter à son rôle de mari nul dans toutes les situations. Mlle Renée
                        Parny a été fort admirée dans le rôle de Francillon. Ses éclats de passion
                        jalouse ont été rendus avec une vérité saisissante ; son cri de la fin
                        surtout "Il en a menti !" a eu un vrai succès. Les autres acteurs et
                        actrices ont également bien joué leurs personnages : M. Rd. Fournier, grave
                        et chevaleresque dans le rôle du marquis de Riverolles; M. A. Dubosc,. plein
                        d'entrain dans celui de Stanislas de Grandredor; M. Lagrange, sérieux et
                        amical dans celui de Henry de Simeux ; M. J. Laurent, le clerc de notaire un
                        peu fat ; M. thomann, le vrai type du dégénéré dans Jean de Carillac ; Mme
                        Pauline Patry, amie sincère et dévouée; Mlle Georgette Loyer la jeune fille
                        enjouée; M. Despair, d'une niaiserie affectée dans un rôle de
                        domestique.</p>
                    <p>On peut dire comme conclusion et d'uie façon générale que la représentation a
                        été du goût de tout le monde; chacun s'est retiré avec l'impression d'avoir
                        assisté à une bonne pièce, jouée par de bons artistes.</p>
                    <p>La petite boutade, bout du fil} qui a précédé la comédie, a été jouée avec
                        tout le brio nécessaire. M. Thomann a été un Paul idéal, Mlle Darmony a été
                        délicieuse dans le tôle de la dame et M. Despair d'une rosserie achevée dans
                        celui de l'ouvrier, Ce soir, môme programme </p>

                        small three-stamp sampling mill has run for the mouth of December on ore
                        taken from winzes No. 3 and 4 north in the 108ft. level; 23 tons of ore were
                        crushed, yielding 63oz. of gold. Nos. 3 and 4 winzes are distant
                        respectively 200ft. and 30 ft. from No. 1 winze, from which the exceedingly
                        rich stone has hitherto been obtained, and further that the mill mentioned
                        must not be contused with the heavy stamp mill, which is expected to
                        commence crushing during this month.</p>

                    <p>I do not agree with Mr. Lang Anderson when he asserts that the fellah keeps
                        money in his house, and that in this way the fellaheen are enabled to
                        purchase land, etc., owing to the large capital they possess. That is not
                        the case here at any rate. Having lived in this part of the country for 16
                        years, I can speak as to the habits of the average fellah. If he has any
                        money after paying his taxes and necessary expenses, he either gets a new
                        wife, or goes to Mecca. In this way his spare money goes and he never thinks
                        of banking it. When he does boy more land, as was the case with the
                        fellaheen who bought the diara Sanieh land, he pays for it in 10, 15, or 20
                        years; whereas had he the money, he would pay the purchase money at once.

                    <head>THE COSSACK OF THE DON.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Thos. Atwood writes: —The latest war news seems to indicate that we are
                        about to see some entirely new developments, in which the Russian cavalry
                        will play a leading part. This will be a welcome change from the sickening
                        details of carnage which have formed the staple of our information the past
                        few months. While the gigantic armies of Kuropatkin and Oyama are still face
                        to face and both inactive, the Russians seem to be at last bringing the
                        Cossack cavalry into action, and we are told that an enormous force under
                        General Mist-chenko is displaying great activity, many detachments raiding
                        in the rear of the Japanese army.</p>
                    <p>Little has as yet been heard of the famous Cossacks in this-war, and now that
                        they are appearing on the scene, it is interesting to refer to the graphic
                        description of these renowned horsemen, given in the letters from Mr. A. G.
                        Hales that appeared in a London contemporary a few months ago. Reading .
                        these one is reminded of tales, of the.prowess of the North American Indian
                        and of "Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show," which no doubt has been visited in
                        past years by many of us now in Egypt. Having remarked on the way the
                        Cossack studies his horse, Mr. Hales goes on to say, "I don't think they
                        have any societies for the prevention of cruelty to horses, (but they look
                        aft6r them because they love them, like the good sportsmen they are, and
                        because they blow the tremendous part the horse is going to play in-the
                        fighting that. is j coming when the snows are on the ground."</p>
                    <p>After describing the feats accomplished by the Cossack in mounting and
                        guiding his horse (cowboy like), Mr. Hales gives the details of what he
                        justly terms "a pretty sight." He says—"One of the prettiest sights I ever
                        saw was a regiment of Cossacks in full charge. They came along like a
                        thunderbolt, their swords all out, the men crouching far over their horses'
                        necks, their knees at an angle that a modern American jockey adopts. All at
                        .once the officer, who was galloping well ahead of his men,—where, by the
                        by, the Russian officer always rides in battle,—stood bolt upright, his
                        sabre swept upwards from ; the hip, flashed over his head and came down like
                        a streak of fire in an imaginary cut at the head of an infantryman. He did
                        not utter a word, but the whole regiment rose in their stirrups like„ one
                        man and copied his action. The next moment the swords were home in the
                        scabbards, every horse was down, the men were lying across the bodies,
                        carbines were out, volley after volley rang out. Im-! mediately afterwards
                        the horses were upontheir hoofs like magic, the men bounded into the
                        saddles, the whole regiment wheeled like seagulls on the wing, and rode off
                        to take cover five hundred yards away in the rear, behind a rapidly
                        advancing column of infantry who came upon the scene with bayonets
                        fixed.</p>
                    <p>These men were going into action in the course of a few months against the
                        Japanese."</p>
                    <p>It will be interesting to note if in the days to come, these wonderful riders
                        achieve any great successes, and merit the encomiums passed on them by Mr.
                        Hales, more especially as many of the events anticipated by him have come to
                        pass in a way that shows his remarkable acumen and foresight </p>
                    <p>If this wretched war is to go on— and there is as yet no sign that the
                        Japanese realise how completely they have failed to achieve the objects with
                        which they set out ou their ambitious venture— one can only hope that
                        finesse and strategy may take the place of such butchery as has hitherto
                        shocked—although it has not roused to action — all civilised nations.
                        Kuropatkin has now made a move in this direction and if it only succeeds in
                        effecting a crippling of the Japanese communications, perhaps an important
                        step may have been taken towards bringing about the peace we all hope to see
                        come, long before either side is exhausted by the struggle.</p>

                    <head>HYDROPHOBIA IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The serious increase in the number of cases of hydrophobia which has taken
                        place of late in Egypt has led to the publication of a timely pamphlet on
                        madness among the canine race by Dr. L. D. Teboulle, of the Veterinary
                        Service at Alexandria. The purpose of this work, "La Rage chez le Chien," is
                        to set forth in a convenient form, for the benefit of the publie, a number
                        of important facts about this terrible malady, for,as Dr. Teboulle
                        observes:—</p>
                    <p>Combien d'accidents seraient évités si, chaque propriétaire de chien avait
                        une connais-sance sommaire de la maladie ! Bon nombre de cas de rage
                        resteraient sans autre conséquence fâcheuse que la perte de Tanimal enragé,
                        si son maître savait seulement :</p>
                    <p>1.Que le chien enragé peut boire et manger jusqu'au dernier moment ;</p>
                    <p>2.Que tout chien qui modifie ses habitudes sans causse apparente est suspect
                        de rage.The pamphlet is well worth obtaining by all dog fanciers. As a proof
                        of the efficacy of an intelligent system of fighting the disease, the writer
                        mentions that when the muzzling order was put in force in 1895 no less than
                        675 cases of madness among London dogs had been brought to the notice of the
                        authorities. As soon as muzzling was enforced, the number of cases of canine
                        madness decreased as follows : 1896 to 458, 1897 to 151, 1898 to 17, 1899 to
                        9, 1900 to 6, 1901 to 1. It would be a work of supererogation to expect that
                        such results will ever be obtained in Egypt, where rules and regulations are
                        so seldom intelligently or consistently enforced. </p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir,— Yesterday, by the 11 a.m. train, Mr. McGiUivray, of the National
                            Bank, left for Suez.on what the writer of the scurrilous paragraphs,
                            which from time to time appear in a Cairo newspaper, imagines to be "a
                            big-game shooting expedition." That he is after "big game" I have no
                            doubt, but that is his and the National Bank's business. This morning
                            bright and early, as soon as Mr.McGill-ivray was well out of the way,
                            like on previous occasions, this journal comes out with another of its
                            attacks upon him and the National Bank. I have not taken up my pen to
                            defend either the Bank or my friend Mr. McGiUivray from this fresh
                            attack by one who is afraid to write when "Mac" is anywhere in the
                            immediate neighbourhood, as that is quite unnecessary, but only to
                            refute the insinuation that Mr. McGiUivray has severed his connection
                            with the National Bank, and that, on apoount of the puerile efforts of
                            the writer of file paragraphs in question. Mr. McGiUivray has not
                            severed his connection with the National Bank; on the contrary he has
                            been sent by the Bank on a mission requiring confidence and ability :
                            for that reason the Bank has selected the mam who a few years ago was "
                            in a comparatively obscure position " and who by sheer hard work and
                            ability, without influence, has worked his way to the position of being
                            one of the leading men in the leading financial institution of
                            Egypt.</p>

                        <p>To the Editor or the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir,—Your allusions on Friday last to the doings of certain high
                            officials of the Coast Guard Administration were not quite justified
                            under prevailing circumstances. The pur chase of camels is an important
                            matter requiring a great deal of experience. I admit that a native
                            officer might buy them much cheaper ; but there are other points to be
                            considered which he is apt to neglect. On a previous occasion this duty
                            was delegated to an English subordinate and I recollect that he branded
                            all his purchases with the same number, thus making it impossible to
                            distinguish one beast from another in the reports. Hence it is obviously
                            necessary that very superior officials should be present to organise the
                            details of the purchase.</p>
                        <p>What objections can you have to the Director-General going for a cruise 1
                            He is surely as useful out at sea as in Cairo, where there is precious
                            little real coastguard work to be done. Certainly there is, not much to
                            be found in the Red Sea, but he might drop across smugglers there and
                            seize their cargo. What is the good of having cruisers if you can; use
                            them when you want to? And the largest of them was beautifully fitted up
                            specially for the Director-General. It would be a pity to employ that
                            one on mere coast patrol work. If we do use our ships for pleasure trips
                            we are only following the example of the P. W. D., whose steamers are
                            lent to almost anybody but the officials who really require them.</p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette,</p>
                        <p>Sir,— The petition of the telegraph clerks in the "Gazette" of Friday
                            last exposes a state of things which is a positive disgrace to the
                            officials who "manage" the department. A similar condition of affairs
                            would, if make no doubt, be found to exist at thé Post Office. Hence
                            delay, irregularity, and pilfering. When the police ask for shorter
                            hours or an increase of pay there is a ready reply : "You are not a
                            revenue; earning department" But that answer cannot serve in the case of
                            the Telegraph or Post Office Departments.</p>
