                    <p>If the statement that M. Delcasse is the real author of the now famous
                        articles in the "Matin" is correct, the ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs has
                        played his country a sorry trick in giving the world what common sense would
                        have left unwritten and unsaid. Germany is still a dangerous power to
                        provoke; the failure of her forces against the Hereos does not imply that
                        they are unfitted for European warfare, their tactics, however unlike those
                        of the Man- churian campaign, differing in no essential from those employed
                        in the French manoeuvers, and the idea that a great anti-German conspiracy
                        had been formed at the time of the first difficulties that arose from the
                        Kaiser's visit to Morocco might enlist millions who have hitherto offered
                        lukewarm support or frank opposition to the IMperial policy, in the cause of
                        "Gott, Kaiser, and Vaterland." There is no question that the German military
                        party, if unwilling to face France and Russia, would welcome the oppurtunity
                        of encountering France single-handed, and the British offer of 100,000 men
                        would not save the situation were the French armies to be overthrown on the
                        frontier. We prefer to believe that M. Delcasse is too good a friend of his
                        country and of the Anglo- French entente, to risk the future of both by so
                        strange an in- discretion. To publish the British offers to aid France, to
                        indicate the British plan of campaign, and to irritate German Chauvinists
                        and French and British diplom- atists alike is not worthy of a diplomatist.
                        The articles are more probable the work of some ingenious and sensational
                        journalist anxious to see the "Matin" sell well, but even so they will not
                        improve the continental situation, terribly strained by the efforts of
                        Chauvinists, and complicated by the Austrian difficulty and the financial
                        and military reverses of Russia. That an understanding between France and
                        England is necessary, we admit; understandings are often the parents of
                        alli- ances, but that the publication (or invention) of military and
                        diplomatic correspondence of the highest importance exchanged between the
                        two powers with a view to meeting an attack by the third, seems to us to be
                        an extra ordinary error of judgement, calculated, unless promptly denied; to
                        precipitate the event to avoid which the entente was sealed.</p>

                        <p>Sir William Broadbent, the King's eminent physician, says that Professpr
                            Behring's statement of the discovery of a cure for tuberculosis commands
                            the respect and attention of the entire world, as emanating from the
                            discoverer of the antidiphtheric serum and a man of high scientific
                            reputation. His announcement of a curative agents only amounts as yet to
                            conviction and awaits demonstration. It is hoped, however, that this
                            newest tuberculin will not share the fate of its predecessors.</p>

                        composed of Messrs. D. Macdonald, A. Gregory,and A.G. K. Levick. After being
                        sworn they proceeded to view the body at the Citadel, and on their return to

                        entered the month and came out at the back of the neck. At this stage the

                    <head>DISMISSAL OF A VALI.</head>
                    <p>Our readers have doubtless remarked the numerous arrests and perquisitions
                        effected by the Khafieh or Ottoman secret police in Syria at the expense of
                        Egyptians or persons in frequent communication with Egypt during the spring
                        and summer of the present year, to which we have given some prominences in
                        our columns. It appears that the Turkish central authorities, alarmed by the
                        temporary success of the revolt in the Yemen, and terrified by the reports
                        of certain mischief-makers, who are unhappily domiciled in Egypt, of an
                        impending Arab rising, have for some time past encouraged the local
                        authorities to search houses for arms and seditions literature, to arrest
                        sheikhs and notables, and in short to add fresh burdens to the lives of
                        their subjects. It now appears that the Porte has begun to suspect the
                        reports of its own agents, and an instructive story reaches us from Aleppo
                        which goes far to support our view that the "Nahda Arabiya’’ bogy was used
                        by unscrupulous agents to secure the Acquiescence of a frightened government
                        in their corrupt and oppressive practices.</p>
                    <p>It appears that the Vali of Aleppo recently informed the Mabein that he had
                        seditious news and begged to be allowed to convey it to Constantinople.
                        Leave was granted him and the nervous governor informed the Porte that a
                        terrible Arab plot to seize Aleppo was maturing and could only be checked by
                        prompt and severe measures. He therefore begged to be allowed to seize all
                        weapons and search every house in the town. The Government, which was aware
                        that Aleppo contained large numbers of wealthy merchants, showed a certain
                        reluctance to commence operations without getting further details of the
                        plot. Enquiries proved that the story of the conspiracy was based on the
                        flimsiest evidence ; the nervous Vali was removed and Nazim Pasha, ex-Vali
                        of Diarbekir, rules in his stead.</p>

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA SWIMMING CLUB. SATURDAY’S AQUATIC SPORTS.</head>
                    <p>The third annual aquatic sports of the Alexandria Swimming Club were held in
                        the new Graving Dock, Gabbari, on Saturday afternoon before a large
                        gathering of visitors which far excelled the attendance on previous
                        occasions, and showing how much the club is advancing. Among those present
                        we noticed H.H. Prince Aziz Hassan, Rear-Admiral Sir R. Massie Blomfield,
                        K.C.M.G., and Lady , Blomfield, Mr. Freeman, acting British Consul General,
                        and Mrs. Freemau, Mr. Ambrose Ralli, Vice-President of the Municipality, Mr.
                        Critchley, manager of the imperial Ottoman Bank, and Mrs. Critchley, Artin
                        Bey Rizian, and many others of the elite of Alexandria. During the coarse of
                        the afternoon a telegram was received from H.E. Sir Reginald Wingate Pasha,
                        regretting his inability to attend, and expressing his wishes for an
                        entirely successful afternoon, and Mr. A. Mitchell Innes, Under Secretary of
                        State, Ministry of Finance, also wrote regretting that a previous engagement
                        prevented him being present and wishing the club every success in their
                        meeting. The weather was delightful, but the burning sun was rather trying
                        during the earlier part of the afternoon. The want of a swimming bath is the
                        more especially felt on these occasions, end we express the hope that at no
                        very distant date the Municipality will make an effort to supply this
                        long-felt want. There are a large number of swimmers and bathers in
                        Alexandria, and during the hottest parts of the trying summer days the
                        luxury of a bath is denied to the many who are unable to afford the time to
                        go out to the covered baths at San Stefano or Mex. As we prophesied, some
                        excellent swimming was witnessed, and so well were the handicaps framed that
                        the spectators were more than once at a loss to distinguish between the
                        winner and swimmer-np. The dock was very effectively decorated for the
                        occasion with flags and, with the gay assembly, presented a very animated
                        scene. Mounted and foot policemen, kindly provided by the authorities, kept
                        the approaches and entrances clear; in fine everything had been most
                        excellently arranged and the organising committee are to be congratulated
                        upon the success with which their hard labour met. Mr. Walter F. j Sarjeant,
                        chairman of the club, showed himself to be a hard worker and able adviser ;
                        Mr. H. S. Martin, hon. sec., who has devoted every moment of his spare time
                        to the work since his return from leave, must be especially pleased at the
                        reward of success, which was in a very large measure due to him; and we most
                        not omit to mention Messrs. Purvis and Webb, under whose supervision the
                        dock had been prepared to receive the members of the club and their guests.
                        Mr. D. Dampergola's Orchestra helped to enliven the proceedings with a
                        number of selections admirably rendered. But to turn to the sports
                        themselves: these, though not astounding when compared with the world’s
                        records, were nevertheless of a high class and showed what great good the
                        formation of n swimming club in Alexandria had done. The progress was marked
                        and the performances of the juniors were especially creditable, and pleasing
                        as promising a great future for the club. For event I., which consisted of
                        the four preliminary heats of the 60 yards handicap for H. E. the Sirdar’s
                        medal, seventeen competitors turned out. In the first heat A. A. Eeclestone
                        and N. W. Ames cameijn 1st and 2nd respectively, in the second heat W. Wood
                        and C.S. Scarth ; in the third E.A. Darton and G. N. Cheeseman, aand in the
                        fourth P.E. Harrison and W. 0. Mace. Event II. was the 60 yards juniors'
                        handicap for members under sixteen years of age. Five boys competed and the
                        excellent handicapping was shown by the nearness of the race. Harry
                        Ecclestone, a boy only just turned si. years, went off in nob’e style and
                        the plucky little fellow kept his lead to the end amid loud shouts of "Go
                        it, nipper." W. H. Talbot, however, drew up to the leader very well and was
                        closely followed by C. E. L. Randall, who had to give 85 seconds start to
                        Elsworth, and between the first three competitors there was barely the
                        difference of a "touch." Event III., 60 yards veterans’ handicap for members
                        of 35 years of age and over, was won fairly easily by W. Wood, but only a
                        few inches separated A. Jackman and M. B. Irvin, who came in 2nd and 3rd
                        respectively. The final of the Sirdar’s medal handicap was then swum off,
                        the competitors being W. Wood, G. N. Chessman, P. E. Harrison, N. w. Ames,
                        C. S. Scarth, E. A. Darton, W.O. Mace and A. A. Ecclestone. Ecclestone was
                        scratch, conceding seventeen seconds to the limit man, and he won the race
                        in a splendid manner. Starting off with a clean and strong stroke he almost
                        immediately gained ground, and as the winning point was approached he just
                        managed to overhaul Darton. His excellent swim and graceful action excited
                        general admiration, and he was hailed as winner with loud applause. Darton,
                        too, made a splendid fight, gaining second place, and Cheeseman came in a
                        very good third. The juniors diving championship, for which a cup was
                        presented by the hen. sec., followed. The diving which was from 3.5, and 8
                        feet, was not of an exceptionally high order, but considering the ages of
                        the competitors it was as good as could be expected. Randall secured the cup
                        and Mitchinson and Harry Ecclestone were awarded 2nd and 3rd places
                        respectively. Event VI plunging championship, followed. As in previous years
                        much difficulty was experienced, in marking off the distances but the judge
                        finally placed Ames, A.B. Collier, end Mace. <cb n="6"/>1st, 2nd, and 3rd in
                        order of the names. The prizes for this event were very kindly presented by
                        the Alexandria Tramway Company Ltd., while the cup was given by the
                        Alexandria and Ramleh Railway Co. Event VIL was a pole watch between the
                        Alexandria Swimming Club and the Eastern Telegraph Company which was very
                        evenly contested, though the E.T.C. had not been been able to practice for
                        the match. The club were the first to score, Darton throwing in with
                        splendid aim very soon after play began. ei d half time was called with the
                        iowe care ab 1 to niL On changing ends the E.T.C. did better and drew even
                        with a good shot from Incledon but only a minute before time. Ecclastone
                        scored for the club and thus secured them the verdict. A ten minutes
                        interval was then given but was not without some amusement; Mr. Martin, who
                        bad been on dry land all this time, supervising and judging; was suddenly
                        seized with a craving for the water and rushing along the spring board
                        shoved off for a dive with the full force of his fourteen and a half stone;
                        the board snapped and it was only the last fibers of wood which prevented it
                        from accompanying him in his dive; he also gave some neat exhibition dives.
                        The blindfold race insugurated the second half of the programme and afforded
                        endless amusement. Some swam in circles, others returned to the starting
                        point almost immediately, and not a few endeavoured to entangle themselves
                        in tubs bad life-buoys which were placed on one side to await the obstacle
                        race. Collier, swimming remerkably straight, won fairly easily and was
                        followed by Mace and Lovell almost together. The seniors’ diving competition
                        followed this and some very good diving was witnessed. The winners were, in
                        order, Collier Ecclestone and Darton. The first, two tying for first place,
                        had to dive again, when Collier gained the verdict owing to Ecclestone
                        turning over slightly. Darton was inclined to "buck” but just kept outside
                        the limits of the definition and his neatness obtained him third place. The
                        obstacle race was most amusing and exciting. The competitors had to pass
                        through life-buoys and barrels and over and under poles and some curious
                        struggles were witnessed. Irvin the limit man looked a certain winner but on
                        his return he stuck in a barrel and, being of no slight build, it was with
                        great difficulty that he managed to extricate himself. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
                        places were awarded to Ecclestone, Mace, and Scarth respectively. The
                        Military polo match between teams of the Departmental Corps and Royal Berks
                        was well fought but the former were distinctly superior and won fairly
                        easily by 4 goals to 1. The Royal Berks were rather weakened by the
                        department of their best men for Khartoum but they made a splendid fight
                        against a strong team and there was very little fouling. Each member of the
                        winning team received a money prize. The juniors then “walked the pole" and
                        for this event, Randall secured the only prize. The seniors followed and
                        Collier was the only competitor to take the flag out of its socket and
                        therefore gained the verdict. When the military tug of war came off it was
                        getting dark. The Departmental Corps and Royal Berks pulled against each
                        other and as in the polo match the former won by two pulls to nil, and this
                        was the concluding event.</p>
                    <p>Lady Btomfield then distributed the prizes supported by Prince Azic Hassan,
                        Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield, K.C M.G., Mr Waiter F. Sarjeant, and Mr.
                        Martin, but be before we refer to this part of the programme we must mention
                        that she was presented on her arrival at 4 p.m. with a beautiful bouquet by
                        Mr. Walter F. Sarjeant, and at the conclusion she was asked to accept a very
                        handsome silver card case from the club as a souvenir of the pccassion.
                        After each successful competitor had reveived his reward Mr. Sarjeant made a
                        short speech in which he thanked Lady Blomfield for her kindness and the
                        interest which she took in the club as was shown by her presence there that
                        afternoon at the centre of such a large gathering. H.H. Prinoe Aziz Haasan
                        and Admiral Blomfield were, he said, very welcome guests. To Prince Aziz he
                        had to offer the heartiest thanks on behalf of the club for the generosity
                        whcch he had shown that afternoon in offering a prize for any race next year
                        which the club might choose. It has since been decided that a 220 yards
                        scratch race will be swum for the Prince's prize, which will be a valuable
                        silver cup. Remarking upon the success of the club Mr. Sarjeant mentioned
                        that when it was formed three years ago there was but a handful of members
                        while now they numbered two hundred and seventy. Before the gathering broke
                        up, Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield in a short speech proposed a vote of thanks
                        to Mr. Sarjeant and the energetic committee who had organised the sports and
                        expressed the great pleasure which it bad been to Lady Blomfield and himself
                        to witness the excellent exhibition of the art of swimming which had taken
                        place that afternoon. We must not omit to mention that the chairman of the
                        Club has kindly given a silver cup for the seniors’ diving championship and
                        that the captains of the merchant marine service trading to Alexandria have
                        most generally promised to present a cup for a junior championship to be
                        decided upon later.</p>

                    <head>THE SITUATION IN CRETE.</head>
                    <p>During the past three months affairs have gone from bad to worse in Crete.
                        The situation, which was serious enough in the spring, has become infinitely
                        more acute and more menac- ing, the prospect of a pacification has become
                        more remote, the attempt, made by the foreign Consuls to arrive at an
                        understanding with the insurgents has remltedln.failure, and to all
                        appean^oe tho four protecting Powers are now confronted with tho painful
                        necessity of crushing tho in-.urreotionary movement 'by force. The only
                        alternative—that of yielding to tho demands of the insurgents and practic
                        ally transferring the government of the island to Greeco—i* apparently not
                        to be thought of, and the somewhat scandalous oantliot between liberators
                        and liberated has already entered upon its earlier stagtoTWith the approach
                        of winter it is probable that las. may be heart of the Cretan trouble; when
                        the snow appears on c the mountains a portion of the insurgent forces will
                        doubtless disperse, and temporary tran- qnillity may furnish a theme for
                        soothing official assurances; but it is almost certain that tho earlier
                        months of the spring will witness a recrudescence of the movement, and the
                        prob- lem to be faced may dvou grow in difficulty, It is unnecessary to
                        enter minutely into the question of responsibility for the present
                        lamentable situation. From the accounts of the inception and progress of the
                        revolutionary movement already published in the "Times” it will be gathered
                        that the main , factors of trouble have been, on the one hadd, the growth of
                        a bitter spirit of faction in Crete, and on the other the inability or
                        unwillingness of the Powers to discern the stormcloud which for tho last
                        four years has been gathering in the island. To (he deadly fend between the
                        Cretan parties mnst, ini the first place, be ascribed the ill-euccow which
                        has attended the recent efforts at pae tication, for the insurgents have
                        been unwilling to' accede to any settlement which • would leave the High
                        Commissioner and his friends at the head- of affairs; while the loyalists,
                        or Court party, have been equally determined to thwart any arrangement which
                        might enable their opponents to boast that they had obtained important
                        constitutional or finan- cial reforms from tho Powers. Events of great
                        interest and importance in other parts of the world have divorted the
                        attention of official and unofficial Burope from the Near Bast in general
                        end from Crete in particular, with the result that ' a situation has been
                        allowed to grow op, both bore and in Macedonia, which sooner or later must
                        add considerably to the Eastern 'problem. The questions involved in that
                        problem lose none of their intrinsic impor- tance tecaose epoch-making
                        events are taking place elsewhere, and. tho trite precept obsta principiis
                        is none the less to be observed because the symptoms of ooming trouble are /
                        comparatively insignificant. The matter of mischief, says the proverb, is no
                        bigger than a midge’s wing. In the more recent developments of the the
                        Cretan trouble, as in its earlier phases, the obstacles which confront the
                        eflorta of the Powers towards pacification are mainly due to tho internecine
                        character of the conthot between tbeiwo Cretan parties. Bach is determined
                        to 'outwit-and, if porsiblo, to annihilate the other, and it would be an
                        error to suppose that the difficulties in the. way of an arrangement emanate
                        from the insurgent camp alqnt At the timo ol the outbreak the official1
                        party, for -obvious reasons, was unwilling to admit that "ibo men of
                        Therisso” ootlld succeed in alter- ing tho political- status and
                        persistently minimised the importance of tho rebellion to the Consols, who
                        naturally waited /or develop- ments-in the hope that' it wonld die a natural
                        death, as they were assured it must do, owing to want of support from the
                        population in in general. But tho action of the Assembly in issuing a rival
                        proclamation of unjfou with Greece, though intended to take the wind from
                        the sails of tho insurgents, in reality in- creasod-their prestige
                        throughout the island, while it diminished that of the official patriots,
                        who, though willing to flout the Buropean Areo- pagus on papor. were not
                        prepared to abide their oomfortable appointments;and allowed the Hellenic
                        standard to be lowered by the foreigners without firing a shot At the same
                        time a speech delivered by anch an inflaeitrial and high-principled patriot
                        as M. Sphakiiiski, decided many wavorers to throw - in their lot with the
                        insurgents. The categorical rejeotion-of the Union by the Powers (May La),
                        ooup'od with a promise ot administrative and financial reforms and a threat
                        of military and naval measures in case of contumacy, produced a sobering
                        effeot on both parties, and it seems probable that if the Powers bad been
                        ready at this moment to make a strong display of force and at the same time
                        to unfold a definite and wide reaching project of reforms, the oonrse of
                        events would have followed a different direotion. Bnt in- decision and a
                        want of unanimity seemed to prevail among the various Cibiaets, whioh, to
                        say the truth, were occupied with other matters: reiof iioemoit* arrived
                        slowly,, and time, passed od, while the insurgent* were enabled to
                        strengthen their position from one end of the island to the other. Above
                        all, the fatal mistake was committed of allowing small bodies of the native
                        gendar- merit, whioh the Opposition regards as the immediate instrument ofi
                        a tyrannical Govern ment, to oome into armed ooi fliot with the insurgents,
                        and, what was still more nnfertun ate, mixed detachments of gendarmerie anc
                        international troops were sent into tip interior. This ill-advised policy
                        was in oonsqQanoe with the'designs of the official party, whioh aimed at
                        setting the Powers aux prises, with the insurgents ; it was ad’vooated by
                        the French authorities, probably from ignorance of local conditions, and by
                        the Basriam 600 motives ttot known to tbomielm The consequences has been
                        that the international troops, whom the insurgents solemnly declared they
                        regard- ed as friords and wonld never oppose, have been entangled in s
                        series of engagements resalting in onto senary blrodshrd, and a spirit of
                        hostility has been created on all sides which rendors an arrargoment more
                        difficult in the futare. On Jone 4 the insurgents replied to the pro-
                        clamatiori of tho Power*. They declared that they bowed to the decision of
                        the four Govern- ments, bnt hoped^ftat until the protecting Powors
                        shonld/fimi it possible .to grant the union with Grcooo they would permit
                        tho in- troduotion of conditions of ljfo more in con- .formitv w\th the
                        requirements of Civilii ition. They arow attention to the financial
                        situation, pointing out that the island was opable to sop- port the expense
                        of a separate Administration, and that while Crete, as a portion of the
                        Turkish Empire, was not allowed to increase her injport tariffs, her
                        exports, whether to Greece or Turkey were treated as foreign mer- chandisn.
                        They urged that the constitutional and autonomous govrirment intended by the
                        Powors had boo a- converted into an absolute rfgime, that oonstifntional
                        reform would prove a failure, snasmuch as there would be no goarantee for
                        its conscientious application, and tjiattho substitution of a foreigner for
                        the present High Commissioner would be hurtful to the Rational sentimonts of
                        tho Cretans. They therefore begged that tho Powers,.while main- taining the
                        nominal sureraioly of the Sultan, wonld entrust the government of the island
                        to Greece, allowing the Cretans to make their own anangementsMn regard to
                        the details of administration the two countries to form a single
                        administrative -end financial organisa- tion.'‘With regard to the demand for
                        disarma- ment, the doenmont pointed ont that, as the authority if the Cretan
                        Government had disappeared in the,interior, an'axmed force was necossary for
                        the maintenance ot publio ordot and for tho protection of the revolutionary
                        Government against the attaoks of its enemies; that tho reappearance of the
                        gendarmerie in the oountry districts wonld exasperate the population, bpt
                        declared that, with the excep- tion of the neoeesary armed guards,, all the
                        population wonld be summoned to) lay down arms. The solution propounded by
                        the insurgents was not devoid in ingenuity as a means of pre- serving the
                        international eituatioh while prao- tically bringing about the Union It
                        resembled the projeot which has long found favor at Athens—the occupation of
                        the.idapd by Greece on tho same line*'.at ih it of. Bos and Herze- govina by
                        Austin, w.th the'moortant differ ence that the Cretans were to be left free
                        to mike their own -bargain with the Hellooio I Government. The refu.-jU of
                        the summons for j complete disarmament derived some justifies- tion from the
                        fact that the Powers had taken no measures for the occupation of the
                        interior, while tho partisans of the Government were already organising
                        bands for the destruction of tho revolutionaries. 8o‘me little time before
                        the reoeipt of tho insurgents’ reply two of the High ( Commissioner's
                        counsellors had sent in their , resignation, and wbpn qooriicDed by tho (
                        Consuls with regard to their motives for this ' step avowed thoir intention
                        of repairing to tho , mountains—not to join caato with tho men of I
                        Therisso, bat to wage war against them. Fortn- , nately, wiser connsels
                        prevailed, and the two , State officials have' not yet exchanged the pen for
                        the rifle. After a decent interval, during which the Gpvernments of the
                        protecting Powers were made aware of the obduracy of thS insurgents, another
                        pfoclamati n was issued by the Consuls (Jnly 15) which partook of the
                        character of an , ultimatum. A period of 15 days was aooorded to the
                        revolntionarie8 for disafmament; those who obeyed were granted an amnesty;
                        in case ( of oontumaoy the Powers reserved tha right of proclaiming martial
                        law. This manifesto was read to a delegation of the insurgents by Mr.
                        Howard, tho British Consul-General, as doyen -of the Consular Corps, who
                        subsequently delivered a short speech in whioh he once more repeated the
                        resolve of the Powers to make no change in the political status of the
                        island at the present juncture, assured the in- surgents of the avertiop of
                        the Powers to b.uodihed, but warned them of the fatal conse- qnonces
                        resistance wonld entail both to them- refves and to tho welfare of their
                        country, nich had already suffered great material losses owing to the
                        prolongation of anarchy and dis- order. On the other hand, should they sub-
                        mit,tbey wonld be guaranteed complete security of life and pr party, and the
                        Consols would urge their Governments to oonvoke a National Assembly for. the
                        purpose of^liciting Cretan opinion on the snbjeot ot reforms. In oonola-
                        sion Mr. Howard stated that Prinoe George, who was much diftresaed by the
                        c»lami*qne situation, wonld 4° his utmost to ensure the strict ’application
                        of the prorpectivp reforms. The reply of the insurgent leaders to the
                        ultimatum was flelirered to the Consuls on Joly 98 before the rnpiry of ths
                        period laid down for dliarmsment Its tone vu rospoot- ful, bnt a hint was
                        nevertheless oonveyed that the Powers wore too late In their proposals of
                        reform, and that their a/quaintanoe with the existing conditions of tho
                        Cretan problem sjas imperfect It was urged that the moral founda- tions of
                        the present "provisional" rfgxrw had been destroyed by the Government, that
                        the material means of maintaining it werelaokii'g. and that the insurgents
                        would be guilty of a crime against their oonntry if they aooepted an
                        inadequate solution which wonld only lead to fresh catastrophes. They W6re
                        conscious of their weakness in face of the Powers, bnt were convinced of Ibe
                        justioe of their caore and of the sinoerity with whioh the Powers pursued
                        their programme of liberty and civilisation in be Crete, and expressed the
                        belief that an in- oh veetigation eondneted on the spot wonld lead •1 the
                        Powers to Acquiesce in their view, as ‘ It was dear from the general tenor
                        of the oj fniorgente’ reply that their rwolntion bad ^een hardened by the
                        nltimatiim, while they still dung to the hope that the Power* would
                        reconsider thoir policy. The eta of military measures was now inaugurated,
                        and oh July 30 the pons ala issued a proclamation announc- ing the
                        establishment of martial law and in- vesting tho international authorities
                        with special jurisdiction and other powers. Publio meetings were prohibited,
                        and-the hearing of arms, except with permission of the international
                        authorities, forbidden. The last-men- tioned regulation should be enforced
                        with the utmost stringency in view of the growing dinger of civil war..' The
                        arming of ejvilian partisans of the Government is a serious feature in tho
                        situation, and one, of the lssf aota of the Chamber before its prorogation
                        was to givo 1 ffid*l countenance and sanction to these ■ fc-callod guardians
                        of the peace.* Their osstensible dnty-is to protect life^and property bat
                        their real mission is apparently topnriue and exterminate the insurgents,
                        the action of the international.authorities proving too len- iont for tho
                        satisfaction'of party animosity- Tho engagement between the "anti-rovolu-
                        tioniata” under one Uonalris and the insni- gents in the Eissamo district
                        last week is indicative of what may bp expected to happen in every part ol
                        the island should the armed partisans of.the existing rfgime be allowed to
                        supplement tho regulir forces of the Powers- The Cretan Government, it is
                        true, has die- claimed responsibility for the proceeding of Lionakis aud his
                        fellows, some of whom, it hailod from Athens, bat the Buropean Powkrs, who
                        object to the employment of irre- gulars with the Turkish foroee, should be

                        aiding the revolution. On the other hand, tho harshnoss and rigour displayed
                        by tho Russians in the Retimo district are such as to recall the familiar
                        methods of repression adopted in their own country. .The levying of heavy
                        contributions from the villages, the horning of the insurgents’ houses, the
                        regular employment of Christian Bashi-Botouks drawn for the ranks of their
                        enemies, and the chases ii I'homme in the mountains, are, no donbt,
                        effective proceedings in their way, bnt are hardly consonant with the
                        civilising mission which tho Powers have undertaken in the is- land. Tho
                        British authorities at Candia have also adopted severe measures, for whioh
                        justi fication may be found in the neoessity for pro- tecting the large
                        Mohamedan population of tho towo and district, which has been expo ed to
                        aots of violenoe and outrage with the in- crease of anarchy. Those, however,
                        who are familiar with the history of past revolutions in Crete will be slow
                        to attribute all the evil doing to any party alone It is oonoeivable that
                        the close of the open season and the approach of winter, with its hardships
                        and privations, may engender a more pacifio spirit among the Cre- tan
                        part-os, and that the work of reconciliation may bo resumed. Bat tho hope is
                        a slender one aud tho ontlook for the present is gloomy 11 tho extreme. </p>

                         was nil for/*ho whv island, Now, in anticipa-  tion of early rains, the
                        farmers are preparing to  onltivate their fields and "dry sowing” of r
                         ooreals will very shortly commence.</p>
                    <p>The camps on Troodos are one by ore being 1  struck, and most of the visitors
                        from E*ypt c  have already loft that pleasant resort and have  either
                        returned to Egypt, or are spending a .  week or two in Nioosia, and from
                        there are  visiting various places of interest prior to their
                         departure.</p>
                    <p>Nicosia is a convenient centre for those who  are able to remain only a short
                        time b the  Island, and who yet wish to see what there is  0(special btorest
                        A pleasant day’s exoorsion  may be made from there to Eyrenia, a distance
                         of 16 English miles, and its lovely environs.  This little seaport town on
                        the north of the  Island, with its gTand old fort and remains of 1  medieval
                        glory, nestles snngly down by the 1  bine waters of the Mediterranean, into
                        whioh it ]  projects its miniature harbour. It has often :  been described,
                        and, snrronnded as it is by '  carob and olive groves, and backed by the
                        long ,  serrated range of mountains which separates it (  on the south from
                        the plains and which “like  giants stand to sentinel th'enchanted land,” it
                         has for generations been the object of enthn-  siastio admiration on the
                        parts of travellers. By  making an early start by carriage from Nicosia,  it
                        is possible also to inolnde b the day's 1  programme a visit to'the
                        pioturesque 14th |  coatary Abbey of Belfapais, described in the  "Handbook
                        of Cyprus” as the "most beantifnl  and important Gothio monument in the Le-
                         vant" A more lovely situation than that  selected for this glorions
                        building can scaroely  be fonnd anywhere. Rider Haggard, in his  "Winter’s
                        Pilgrimage to 8yria, Palestine, and  the East" describes the view from the
                        refeotory .  window as unrivalled.</p>
                    <p>The grim fortress town and css tie of St  Hilarion of unknown age, and whioh
                        is perched |  upon one of the topmost pinnacles of theKyrenia |  range,
                        provides another day excursion either I  from Eyrenia or Nicosia. In the
                        latter oate the  carriage road is left about If miles outo(l  Nioosia and
                        mules are taken, which bring the  traveller to the castle after aboht an
                        honk's  ride ; by taking lurch with ouo a delightful  and not too' tifbg day
                        may thus be spent. V  Bnfiavento, another ancient mountain for-  tress,
                        cjnoerniog wjiioh “there are legends but  no history”, should also be
                        vi»\ted from  Nioosia. It is.somewhat difficult of aooeas, but  the carriage
                        road brings one within three miles  of the hospitable Monastery of
                        8tChrysostomo,  and after a bait there for lanch, which visitors  -should
                        bring wjth them, an hour’s walk takes  one to the summit and into the ruined
                        castle.  The magnificent view well repays one for the  d fficulty of the
                        journey. To the sooth it em-  braces t early the whole Island of Cyprus,
                         while on the north may be seen,Kyrenia and  the whole length ol the Eyrenia
                        mountain  range, and across the Mediterranean the far  distant boig'hts of
                        the snow oapped Oaramanian  mountains in Asia Minor. It .is much to  be regr
                        thst no handy pcoket guide  briefly desoriptive of these plaoea of interest
                         ii'obtainable; tourists consequently fail to sp-  predate them ss fully as
                        th# otherwise might.  Now that the railway to Famagusta is  completed; that
                        onique old' town, rich in  historical and architectural monuments, may  also
                        ba visited from Nioosia in a day.</p>
