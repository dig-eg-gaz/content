                        <p>Kind Sol still refuses to reign and the weather continues to be miserably
                            wet. The day opens cloudy with a light south breeze and falling
                            barometer. The sun enters Capricornus the afternoon at 2.4 p.m. and
                            winter then begins "officially." The rainfall during the autumn has
                            amounted to 5.37in. as against 4.33 in the autumn of last year.</p>

                    <head>NAVAL EFFICIENCY.</head>
                    <p>The startling character of the Admiralty minute which sets aside the verdict of the court-martial that acquitted Commander Mac-Hutchin in the matter of the loss of his Majesty's ship Assistance, is much commented on in the home Press. Not for many years have the Lords of the Admiralty had occasion, or used it, to lay so heavy a hand on officers of the Navy. It is a painful affair. Bat it is possible and proper in regarding it to unite to a warm sympathy for the officers on whom censure and punishment have fallen a complete acknowledgment of the, justice and wisdom of the drastic minute</p>
                    <p>The facts are within the recent recollection of our readers. The Assistance, a repair ship, went ashore in Tetuan Bay in October, suffering the most serious damage, and it would now seem that it was rather by good look than good management that the other valuable ships in the bay, the battleship Commonwealth, Hindustan, and Canopus, and the cruiser Arrogant, escaped a similar fate. A local Court-martial under the presidency of Sir Berkeley Milne acquitted the commander of the Assistance on a charge of "negligently or by default suffering the ship to be hazarded or stranded." The Lords of the Admiralty, reviewing the evidence, "find themselves unable to appreciate the reasons which led to the finding of the court."</p>
                    <p>They consider, moreover, that the stranding was due to (1) a bad berth, for the choice of which Sir William May, though himself absent, incurs a censure expressed as their lord-ships' "regret"; (2) in sufficiency of able veered, which led to (3) the breaking of the anchor shank, which involves Commander Mao-Hutchin in censure for a lack of knowledge of seamanship; (4) steam not being available at short notice—a precaution inculcated by the "Mediterranean Pilot," an official text-book, under such conditions of sea and weather as prevailed on the night in question. Captain Startin, commanding the Commonwealth, and the senior officer present, is relieved of his command because these precautions were neglected. His was the responsibility for the safety of all the ships, and he admitted at the court-martial that he was not acquainted, before the disaster, with the "Mediterranean Pilot" No one at all directly concerned escapes censure. Sir William May, Captain Startin, Commander MacHutchin, these do not complete the list of delinquents. The captains commanding the Hindustan, Canopus, and Arrogant are censured for the "want of appreciation of their responsibilities,' and the absence of seamanlike precautions," and the officers of the middle watch in all the ships are superseded for neglect of important duty.</p>
                    <p>It is, indeed, a root-and-branch affair, and it falls like a bombshell after the sympathetic and easy-going verdict of the court-martial. But even the officers concerned must recognise that the best interests of the Service are thus best served. The minute enforces the lesson that in the Navy no man can shelter himself behind another's back. Responsibility rests on every officer, and there oan be no escape from its burden. That is the way in which our fleets have been made what they are, and it is the only way in which they can continue to be that sure rook of our defence, without which the Empire must fall to pieces. It is a hard rule of life and conduct which demands efficiency at every moment and permits no extenuating circumstances in the hour of preventable disaster. But it is a rule to which the Navy must submit, and one from which we believe it has not the slightest wish to shrink. The Lords of the Admiralty have been extremely severe, but their judgment is in accordance with facts, and their action will be productive of good.</p>

                       <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                           accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                           they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                           accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                           are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                           things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                           between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                       <cb n="2"/>
                       <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                           January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                           Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                           than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                           the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                           place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                       <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                           sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                           the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>

                       <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                           Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                           line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                       <cb n="5"/>
                       <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                           Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                           express from Alexandria.</p>
                       <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                           is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                           responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                           deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                       <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                           fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                           Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                           />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                       <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                           attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                           been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                           If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                           at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                           arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                           London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                       <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                           leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                           of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                           station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                           occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                           visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                           CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                           Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                           the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                           history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                           413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                           is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                           about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                           delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                           Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                           Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                           Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                           visit.</p>

                           during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                       <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                           steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                           wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                           bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                           [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                       <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                           devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                           portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                           to need comment here.</p>
                       <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                           brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                           City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                           and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                           excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                           fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                           finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                           hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                           Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                           level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                           thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                           takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                       <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                           Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                           possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                           sunset.</p>
                       <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                           and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                           house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                           and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                       <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                           the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                           a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                           breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                       <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                           gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                           constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                           Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                           marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                           filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                       <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                       <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                           Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                           illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                           cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                       <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                           SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                           change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                           Salsomaggiore.</p>

                       <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                           delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                           vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                           bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                           approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                           The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                           behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                           the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                           out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                       <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                           lakes.</p>
                       <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                           hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                       <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                           beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                           enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                           and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                           from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                           steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                           of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                           excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                           town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                           by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
