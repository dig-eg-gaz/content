                    <head>THE CAPITULATIONS.</head>
                    <p>We have never regarded the Capitulations as asorosanot, and recent events
                        have confirmed us in our view that these institutions hav had their day in
                        Egypt. Their existence hase for some time been superfluous, it is now
                        becoming a source of anxiety to all European residents who wish to see
                        harmonious relations existing between Europeans and the natives of the
                        country, and has long since irritated all patriotic Egyptians, who cannot
                        but feel considerable vexation at the difference in the treatment accorded
                        to the native subject who maltreats a European and the toreign subject who
                        mishandles a native. We have no desire to accuse any nationality, any
                        consulate, of partiality in its treatment of the cases that arise between
                        natives and Europeans. We recognize that the European officials and
                        magistrates who at present preside over and compose Consular Courts are an
                        honorable body of men who aim at justice and do their best to be impervious
                        to external influences. But nothing is gained by blinking out eyes to the
                        fact that these courts have not always given satisfaction, and that
                        instances could be given where their decisions have been grossly unfair and
                        have been explained at times by the incapacity, at times by the vensility,
                        of judges. What has occurred before may occur again: every service contains
                        men who are inferior in mental calibre to the bulk of their colleagues, and
                        it is notorious that even judges of the Consular Courts have before now
                        incurred suspicion of dishonesty and worse.</p>
                    <p>Let us then put ourselves for a moment in the place of an educated native of
                        Egypt and consider the Capitulations from his point of view. Would not our
                        thoughts run much as follows: "I, Mohamed Effendi Selim, have no quarrel
                        with the men who compose the courts, but I do not see the necessity for
                        these difference in the treatment of European and native criminals. My
                        servant's brother, a silly fellow no doubt, broke the head of a subject of
                        the King of Lithuania the other day, and by out law he went to gaol, and
                        very rightly too. But when a subject of the Prince of Baratavia stabbed the
                        boawab of the house three doors up the street, who tried to stop him knifing
                        a man in a low café, and the bowab died of his wounds, certain Baratarians
                        on the jury lent a ready ear to the stories of witnesses whose proper place
                        was the dock, and the end of it all was that the foreigner was let off with
                        a ridiculously light sentence. Had he been a native subject he would have
                        had twenty years. Other foreigners have been let out on bail when charged
                        with serious crimes against us and have not been prevented from fleeing the
                        country and evading justice. Our men, if they break heads or use knives, go
                        to prison at once. Their trial nowadays comes quickly, but the subjects of
                        foreign countries wait-free-for months, during which they may bribe
                        witnesses or leave the country. Even if the await trial and the proper forms
                        are observed we notice the difference in the treatment, and if educated men
                        feel as I do, what is said among the ignorant who do not understand legal
                        procedure? Why this, that there is one law for the Moslems and one for the
                        foreigners, that the judges must of a surely be bribed, and that this is
                        tyranny and injustice. We cannot depend on the Consular Courts, they must be
                        honest and just one year but they may disappoint up the next, and the
                        difference in procedure and in penalties puzzles our lower class. There are
                        matters for which our laws inflict severer punishments that theirs, and they
                        do not understand it."</p>
                    <p>Given such a state of mind, can we wonder that any outbreak of crime on the
                        part of low-class Europeans against natives leads to disturbances, for this
                        is not the first time that the Rue Hamamil and Anastasi-street have seen
                        affrays. Instead of looking for evidence of fast conspiracies and portentous
                        plots, let us face the fact that Alexandria contains a multitude of European
                        and native blackguards and that is the position of the town, the first
                        seaport of the Levant, makes it impossible to prevent constant additions to
                        their numbers. "Uno non deficit alter"-you deport a dozen undesirables and
                        thirteen arrive by the next boat. Therefore we must hope for the
                        establishment of Courts in which natives and Europeans will be properly
                        represented on the Bench and in which, whatever the nationality of the
                        European tried on a charge of committing a crime against a native, he will
                        be tried under the same Code and with the same procedure. Otherwise we must
                        expect dissatisfaction among the natives, and as a large proportion of them
                        are ignorant men they may be counted upon to manifest their dissatisfaction
                        by stupid violence. Very regrettable that they should be stupid and violent,
                        but, my dear objector, argument has not yet superseded the half-brick at
                        home, and you show a certain vaivete in deploring the fact in Egypt the
                        argument of the nabout still survives.</p>

                    <head>YESTERDAY IN ALEXANDRIA. NO RENEWAL OF DISTURBANCE TRIAL OF RIOTERS
                        COMMENCES.</head>
                    <p>A great deal was witten and said last week as to what might be expected to
                        occur in the city yesterday. How far there was any real ground for alarm
                        must remain a matter of uncertaintv The certainty is that nothing whatever
                        of an untoward character happened. The trial of the natives accused of
                        participation in the late riot proceeded without anything more serioas than
                        a good deal of shooting in the arrest as the vans conveying the prisoners
                        arrived and departed, and nothing worthy of note took place in Rosetta
                        street</p>
                    <p>The authorities are to be commended for the very effective precautions taken
                        against a further riotous outbreak. Mounted polioe pa- trolled the low
                        quarters of the town, and the latest attempt at riot wonld have been
                        suppressed before it could have attained any serions proportions. But so
                        quiet was every neighbor- hood, that a stranger unaware of the history of he
                        last few days would have wondered what the extra display of force meant. We
                        trust that this state of things may continue and that the rowdyism that has
                        been, unfortunately, so rife among the lower classes, both European and
                        native, may have received a check that will prove effective in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>The trial of the persons implicated in the disturbances of Sunday week took
                        plaoe yes- terday morning, in the Native Court. Rosetta- street The court
                        was prodded over by Abl El Megid Bey Fend, and Mahfonz Bey represented the
                        Parquet, Hopkinson Bey, Morice Bey, and Haddaya Bey being present The number
                        of the accused, brought into he court was 104. In the court-yard a crowd of
                        about 200 natives had gathered, and 40 policemen were on duty.</p>
                    <p>At half-past eleven the president of the Parquet began his speech for the
                        prosecution, naming the persons suspected of rioting. After giving
                        particulars of the charge against 60 or 7O prisoners, Mahtouz Bey asked the
                        Court to allow 5 minuter respite, and this was granted. On resuming, Mahfeuz
                        Bey contnued reading the long list of accused, making comments as he went
                        on. When the reading of the list had been concluded, the president of ihe
                        Patquet addressed the judge somewhat as follows;—</p>
                    <p>"I trust you are not surprised at the spectacle of 104 persons under trial,
                        as the mob that took part in the disturbance of Sun- day afternoon, of which
                        these persons formed part, numbered 15,000 individuals. Indeed, we had not a
                        sufficient number of police to arrest every one who took part in the distur-
                        bance, and that is why the Fire Brigade was re- quisitioned to disperse the
                        thousands of people. Therefore we cannot particularise the circum- stances
                        of the event so far as to report what each of the rioters did. It was some
                        what impossible to do so in such a wide-spread disturbanoe. We arrested 400
                        and after inquiry have discharged 1 half that number. The other haif, i e.,
                        the 200 prisoners, were seen by the police and the sheikhs of the quarters
                        to be making a disturbauoe. Had there been witnesses to prove that the other
                        200 or part of them had taken part in the troubles we should of course have
                        kept them to be tried. Had this disturbance taken plaoe 15 years ago the
                        Court would probably not have found an article in the Penal Code applicable
                        to the present case, for it is only 15 years since Articles 220 and 221 were
                        added to the code, owing to a similar incedent which took place at that
                        time... In short, we have brought these people before you in the hope that
                        they will receive severe punishment to prevent furhter public disturbances.
                        The case was first in the hands of the police, and it then passed into those
                        of the Parquet, and now, the enquiry being oompiete I, beg to lay the case
                        in your hands,trusting you will bear the respon- sibility of giving the
                        proper judgment."</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the speech for the pro- secution, some discussion took
                        plaoe as to the defence of the prisoners, and finally the hearing was
                        adjourned till next Saturday. The trial of the second batch of 71 prisoners
                        took place this morning in the same Court, and was still proceeding as we
                        went to press.</p>

                    <head>CLAN CUMMING HELD RESPONSIBLE.</head>
                    <p>Sir Gorell Barnes and Trinity Masters, in die Admiralty Conrt, on Satnrday we
                        k, joncloded the hearing of the oase of the owners if the Chatham and her
                        crew, suing for loss of fffeotH, v. the owners i f the Clan Camming ind
                        freight. Tbi« was a claim and oonnter- ilaim for damages, owing to a
                        oollision which xoarred between the two vessels in the Suez Banal on
                        September 5 last, resulting in the linking of the Chatham, which oanght
                        fire. 3he wau laden wittyi cargo of 180,' OOlbs. of iyuamite, and 160,600
                        detonators. The sink- ing of the Chatham leenlted in blocking the Muial
                        traffic for a few days, until, by order of tbeqanal authorities, the vessel
                        was blown np. The aotiou now came before the court for a ieoision as to
                        which of the two vessels was to blame for the oollision.</p>
                    <p>Iu giving judgment his Lordship said that in irder to appreciate the
                        oollision it was ne- sestary to tee how these vessels were aproaoh- ing eaoh
                        othur. Ac the part of the canal where the oollisii-n oconned, vessels
                        proosediug louihwaid had to ' tie np" to posts whenever it was neoessaiy for
                        steamers to past np. His Lordship then deait with the rales applying to lse
                        of the searoh-iight and other lighta which iad beeu laid down, m the canal
                        regulations, i'he southern-going vessel must show the iniliant light till
                        ftie pat into the siding, and iben give tbe ordinary light to show she had
                        ;ot iheie. A vessel under enoh oiroumsianoea nuat aot reasonably wheu going
                        south, while !id one going north must watoh and see she lid not get too near
                        the other ship. He thought hat, having regard to the impossiuiiity ot >eiug
                        certain ot the distanoe separating two rcss- Is under these oiroomstanoes,
                        it wa» ibsolutely necessary for the vessel going north- vt>r l to keep
                        herself well in hand, so that she vas oowpletely prepared to deal with any
                        iveutuaheiei she jmght meet from the rhip ouuing south. Sir Gorell Barnes
                        pcin ei out hat each side argued that the other res el had acted in an
                        unreasonable mau- ler, and it was therefore neoe>sary to see vbat really did
                        happen. He had no donbt hat the Chatham was at the time of the oolli- ion
                        practically a stationary ship, and had toted in precisely tin same manner as
                        the had io ed on two previous occasions, wheu she had Irawn up to allow
                        three other vessels to psms. Phe rest of the oa»e was somewhat simple,
                        ieoan«e the collision was a severe ooe, the Han Camming offttug, as she did,
                        right into he bows of the Chatham as iar as the windlass. Phe oely other
                        question was to examine rbe her the Clan Cumining bed proceeded nth proper
                        and reasonable precaution. In his ipmion, and that of the Elder Brethren,
                        those n oharge of the defendanta' ship did not aot essonably in approach ng
                        the Cuatham, having igued to the ludiQations given to them. The blame for
                        the collision rested solely on the bad lavigation of the Clan Camming, and
                        she must ie louud alone to blame for the oollision.</p>
                    <p>After some little argument the question as o whether the ship was properly
                        blown up was aft for farther oousideration.</p>

                        <p>Speaking in the Chamber. M. Rouvier said that the Government meant to
                            keep the Morocco question, within proper proportions. He emphasised the
                            foot that France would at the conference uphold her special rights and
                            interests in Morocco. The independence of Morocco and he introduction of
                            reforms were essential, and ''our rights were the result of
                            negotiations, and if not all recognised , they were at all events all
                            preserved. We calmly await the conference."</p>

                    <head>THE PREVENTION OF MALARIA.</head>
                    <p>In reference to our leading article on the subject on Saturday last, the
                        following ex tract from the article on "The Prevention of Malaria," by
                        Lieut. Col. Giles, in "Climate and Health," will be of interest;-</p>
                    <p>"In by far the majority of cases we must be content with a partial success
                        all along the line, by adopting such measures as may be locally most
                        practicable. In the case. for example, of habitations placed in the midst of
                        canal irrigation, where ample and efficient subsoil drainage is impossible
                        or too expensive, the attempt to destroy mosquitoes can be little bitter
                        than a waste of time and money, for under such conditions the breeding
                        places are so numerous, and appear so constantly in new and unexpected
                        situations, as to defeat the utmost vigilance, and the thorough protection
                        of all habitations against the invasion of mosquitoes, and the careful
                        treatment of all cases with quinine, is all that can be done. On the other
                        hand, in an exceptional case, such us that of the town of Ismailia in Egypt,
                        where the rainfall is practically nil, and the breeding places all of
                        artificial origin, the practical extermination of mosquitoes may be so easy
                        matter as to be effected at a small expense in a single year, with te
                        immediate result of reducing the cases of malaria to a tithe of their
                        previous numbers."</p>
                    <p>All the world, however, knew or ought to know that Ismailia is the place par
                        Excellence where success attended well-organised effort Under the
                        superintendence of Dr. Presa, of the Canal Company, acting on the advice of
                        Major Ross, what was at one time a hotbed of malaria has now become famous
                        as the town which first conclusively demonstrated the possibility of
                        preventing malaria by clearing out its flag bearer, the mosquito. What has
                        been done in Ismailia bas been done in other places. Let us hope that in our
                        other coastal towns at least and in Cairo the example Ismailia will not be
                        ignored.</p>

                        head of the Service des Antiquites shows clearly enough the state to which
                        the Sinaitio inscriptions have been reduced by weather and the depredations
                        of the Bedouin, and that the transport to the Cairo Museum of such of them

                        expedition of last winter. He farther explains how carefully the Sinaitio
                        peninsula was sur veyed when its Egyptian monuments were in a far better
                        state than they are now—first by Palmer and Wihon, then by M. Benendite, and
                        more recently by Dr. Borchardt.</p>

                        brought an action against another to restrain him from using his trade name,
                        which was English and high-sounding. The Judge of the High Court, whom we
                        may call Sir William Ramsbury, in giving judgment against the defendant it,
                        ex plained that he was quite at liberty to adopt any name but that
                        preoccupied by the plaintiff "May I use any name I like ?" said the defeated

                    <p>Some interesting stories of Prince Edward, the eldest son of the Prince of

                        Prince. says the writer, on one occasion Was asked by a little girl whom he
                        met out at tea where he lived. "We live near Whit ley' ," added the child
                        proudly. "Ah." replied Prince Edward, with interest, "that's curious. We
                        live near Gorribee's." Once a gentleman was telling a long and dull anecdote
                        to the Prince and h;s brother. After a time Prince Albert began to show

                        operations in the Suda , 1888, including the action of G maizah (4 h class
                        Medjidieh, clasp) and he was with the 1st Battalion after on its memorable
                        passage o the way to Ladysmith, including the actions of Belfast and
                        Lydenbnrg (medal with two clasps). Major Hickman is on leave till the 31st
                        inst, when he will assume the duties of second in command of the 1st
                        Battalion.</p>
                    <p>Major J G. Fair, D.S.O., 21st (Empress of India's) Lanoers, Hounslow, has
                        taken his retired pay after over twenty years' service in that smart
                        regiment He got his first com-mission in the 21st— then a Hassar regiment
                        —in August, 1885, his troop in 1892, and majority in March, 1900, whilst on
                        active service. major Fair was staff officer to Gatao e at the battle of
                        Atbara, in Kitchener's advance towards Khartoum, and at the battle of
                        Khar-toom he was present in the same capacity (mentioned in despatches, 4th
                        class Medjidieh, British medal, and Khedive's medal with two clasps) He also
                        served in the South African War, earning the D.S.O. and the medal with
                        clasps.</p>
                    <p>Recent changes in the King's Royal Rifle Corps have brought in Captains D.
                        Blundell H llin hed-Blundell, M.V.O., and R. Sims, D.S.0, on the
                        establishment, to which they were supernumeraries.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant B. G. Bromhead and Sargeant H. Harvey, 1st Battalion Royal
                        Berkshire Regiment, Dublin, passed at the in. the advanced course, including
                        the Maxim gun, at the School of Musketry, Hythe. A note to the official
                        announcement states that 'the knowledge displayed by Lieutenant Baggalay
                        (11th Hassars) and Lieute-nant Bromhead was of the highest order." This was
                        in reference to the Maxim gun.</p>
                    <p>The summary of recruiting, just issued by the War Office for 1905, shows that
                        the results were fairly satisfactory. From 1st January of this year till the
                        1st October the figures were —cavalry, 2 726 ; artillery 5 745 ; engineers,
                        703; infantry , 19, 62; departmental corps, 1,386 : total. 29 929. Between
                        the 1st October 1905, and the 30th u t 24.557 men enlisted— 21,498 for nine
                        years. 1,073 for twelve years, and the remainder were short-service men. At
                        the present rate enlistment a substantial addition to these figures is
                        anticipated at the end of the year. The new short-service system is doing
                        pretty well in several districts. "Homesters" the recruits are styled in bar
                        racks.</p>
                    <p>The new Premier, Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman, is not a persona grata with
                        the British Army. As a War Secretary in the Galvestonian Administration of
                        892 he was a Head failure without a single redeeming point and ultimately he
                        blew his party and himself out of office on the cordite question. S
                        cle-verly did he manage things that the stores of that article were almost
                        exhausted, and an adverse vote finished him. But it was reserved for him to
                        be the most vehement traducer of our army during the South African War, when
                        he denounced the army for he "me h ds of barbarism" it pursued in a manner
                        which most have been balm to the feelings of our German cousins. Whilst be
                        and his pro-Boer followers kept the B ers in the field by their delusive
                        speeches, he received many a hearty curse from the brave fellows who were so
                        gallantly keeping the flag flying under the Southern Cross.</p>
                    <p>The Leviathan has been re commissioned at Chatham, with a crew of 891
                        officers and men, for service on the Mediterranean Station, as flagship of
                        the Third Cruiser Squadron.</p>

                    <p>HOW TO BEAUTIFY THE CITY.</p>
                    <p>BY R. WILLIAMS, F.R.I.B.A.</p>
                    <p>Eves accustomed to architectural forms and details may see, here and there,
                        in odd nooks and corners of Alexandria, many fragments of an older city.
                        Pieces of carved or moulded stone, marble or granite may be found, here as a
                        doorstep, there as a boundary mark, or lying prone on the ground balf-bnried
                        in the duse Occasionally, in digging foundations, the "faes" of the digger
                        strikes a piece of Greek sculpture or a Roman base, or a Byzantine capital,
                        and. now and then, a piece of a great monolithic shaft is laid bare and anon
                        come to view old culverts, drains, cisterns, and even cavernous catacombs.
                        Much marble has disappeared for ever in the kilns of the lime burners and a
                        few fragments, specimens of the architectural art as practised in ancient
                        Alexandria, are saved in museums.</p>
                    <p>Alexandria's Architectural Glories.</p>
                    <p>But fragmentary as all these specimens are, sufficient of them remain to help
                        us to piece together in our imagination some of the archi-tectural glories
                        of the columnar halls, palaces, temples, and libraries of the great city of
                        learning founded by Alexander some twenty-two centuries ago. But all has
                        disappeared under the dust of ages, and.save the fragments which tell us of
                        artistic labour and of the dauntless courage in overcoming the difficulties
                        of hewing, carving, polishing, and transporting heavy monoliths a distance
                        of 500 miles from Assouan to the sea, nothing remains. The ancient grandeur
                        of the city has vanished, its great buildings , enriched with the work of
                        the artists of its day in hand, enduring material, have fallen a prey, less
                        to the wear and tear of time, than to the changes and chances of devastating
                        wars.</p>
                    <p>The Old and the New.</p>
                    <p>Like Heliopolis, marked by its much older and finer monument of antiquity—a
                        single obelisk—-so is ancient Alexandra marked by its column set up by a
                        Human proconsul some sixteen hundred years ago. just in time to give it
                        warrant of antiquity, but very late as times are measured in Egypt. The work
                        of the proconsul Pompeins towers up in its lone grandeur and strength of
                        foundation, and if the eyes of the rather roughly cut acanthus leaves of its
                        capital could have seen. they would have become dim with sorrow as they
                        witnessed how. one by one, vandal powers filled the columns of the
                        many-pillared halls, loggias, and arcades that stood around and how, in lieu
                        thereof, town upon the dust and debris of town arose, and how mounds of
                        "shakf" were formed by the broken pottery thrown away by succeeding ages of
                        the populations as they passed down the stream of time, and how by degrees
                        the Alex andria of to day has arisen—a city of Mex stone, soft brick and
                        plaster—a renaissance truly, but a mere spectre of the old, ever crumbling
                        and taming into decay. The old robustness, the bold, spirited handling of
                        blocks of granite and marble and the drawing thereout, with chisel point and
                        mallet, the beauteous forms which lay hidden therein, have given place to
                        tame ornament in fleeting plaster.</p>
                    <p>Signs of Change.</p>
                    <p>There are, however signs of change, to use words often on the lips of the
                        great artist and man of letters William Morris, and strong hopes, yet
                        tremulous fears, for art in this prosperous city of Alexandria. The land of
                        Alexandria is as the land of Ophir, the gold of which was said to be good.
                        The price of land is becoming fabulous, certain tracts of it, already high
                        in price, have, in the space of three months, quadrupled, even though they
                        have lain idle, but this is a property which land possesses all the world
                        over, where many people are congregated.</p>
                    <p>We may perhaps, take the phenomenal rise in the price of land as a good
                        augury, deducting therefrom the following xi m :— The land isn exceed:ngly
                        valuable, ergo the buildings erected will be highly artistic and of good
                        material and substantial: and as a corollary we may assume that there may be
                        at hard the shering in ,of another era of artistic work in Alexandria, and
                        which permeating all life, shall bring pleasure alike to the designer and
                        the worker, to the user as well as to the beholder.</p>
                    <p>Improvement of Alexandria,</p>
                    <p>Like other great towns, Berlin, Paris, and London, Alexandria is improving
                        herself and borders. London has just opened a great new street, cot through
                        a congeries of small streets at a cost of many millions sterling. Paris is
                        busy with its underground railway. and in Germany a most excellent municipal
                        law has been passed whereby municipalities are able to schedule surrounding
                        lands for the future extension of their cities.</p>
                    <p>Alexandria has its fine tr ct of land partly reclaimed from the sea, and to
                        the engineers of the Municipality much credit is due for their fine
                        arrangement of tea wall and double lines of roads. That the elements may not
                        have the mastery over the materials and construction of the sea wall, is the
                        prayer of all who have welfare of Alexandra at heart, but of course time can
                        only tell as to the result. A watchful eye might be kept over the doings of
                        the waves always bearing in mind that in a wall as well as in a garment, "a
                        stitch in time saves nine."</p>
                    <p>Example to our Municipality.</p>
                    <p>Like London with its new street 100 fee wide, Alexandria has in its new
                        esplanade, an opportunity which comes hot rarely in the why of
                        Municipalities, and though the London Council may in the main be a worthy
                        model for other Municipalities, it has, to my mind, committed a grave error
                        in the matter rf the architecture of its new street. It has shackled the
                        architects with a style, which it has designated "Palladian Freely Treated"
                        end the result, thus far, is not altogether satisfactory. Bat there is in
                        the regulations of the Council of London as to the architecture of the new
                        street a stringent clause as to materials. These most be of good stone,
                        marble, granite or sound brick and stone combined. No "stucco" or plastering
                        is to be permitted and in this the Alexandria Municipality may well follow
                        the London Council.</p>
                    <p>Two questions now arise as to the future architectural development of
                        Alexandria, and, here, I know fall well that there are plenty of good men,
                        both native and foreign, who would say to me:—"A fig for your architectural
                        development, let us have more commercial and monetary development." To this,
                        history supplies answers in plenty. To take an instance The decline of
                        Venice began at a period of great commercial prosperity in the fifteenth
                        century. Her nobler life and chaster architectural days had already passed
                        and the force of her energy was now given up to money-making, giving proof
                        if any were needed, that the better days of Venice, or of any city, were
                        those of which it, could be said of the people— that all were for the State
                        and none for self or party. But this is by the way. Let us come to the two
                        questions which concern material and style.</p>
                    <p>Material for building.</p>
                    <p>First as to material. Alexandria has no stone save the soft Mex stone end the
                        native brick, which is also sofa badly burnt The material near at hand,
                        therefore, is only fit for internal walls, and external walls covered with
                        plaster. But Egypt abounds in good sandstone, limestone and red and grey
                        granite. At Tourah there are stones which, if carefully selected, would make
                        excellent building stone, and in making the section the analyses made by Mr.
                        A. Lucas, of the Geological Department, Cairo, will be, if consulted, of the
                        greatest service. Then there is the hard, compact sand-stone of which many
                        of the ancient temples were built and which prove its durability This stone
                        may still be ad without stint in the old quarrie in Upper Egypt.</p>
                    <p>In various parts of the Sudan some good building stones, as that used with
                        affect in building some of the Sudan railway stations, as at Ed Darner, may
                        be found. Above Omdurman in Gebel Awili there is a stone which, if carefully
                        treated, would make good building stone. Of several samples of this stone I
                        have had analyses made by a London expert. There need be no hesitation as to
                        its use in a dry climate, and with treatment of its surface it may be made
                        to withstand the alternations of wet and dry weather.</p>
                    <p>Stone Preservatives.</p>
                    <p>Further, many of the softer stones and even the better quality of the Mex
                        stone might be treated with stone preservative, much as in Britain we treat
                        the softer Bath stone : and here with regard to stone preservatives, I might
                        add that I am now awaiting the arrival. of samples of five different
                        solutions for the continuation of experiments already began, with the view
                        of hardening the best qn^litv of the soft material at hand and so as to free
                        it from its dependence on stucco. Then as to bricks. There are several ways
                        of making bricks. The sand at Ramleh might be turned into brick and the
                        brick earth might be better selected, washed and more thoroughly burned.
                        Lastly, the supply of granite at Assouan is practically unlimited.</p>
                    <p>Granite from Assouan.</p>
                    <p>Egypt abounds, therefore, in material of which the architect can avail
                        himself in which to design (shades worthy of the rising prosperity of
                        Alexandria. But while I write my heart misgives me, and the question occurs
                        •— Is there public spirit and enterprise enough in Alexandria or-in Egypt to
                        undertake the quarrying working and transporting of granite from Assonan to
                        Alexandria, and of course to all towns by the way? The granite is there in
                        great masses. The apparently vast quantity used for the great dam 2,000
                        metres long by 37 metres high, has left no appreciable difference in the
                        vast store awaiting the tool of the worker.</p>
                    <p>Determination, coupled with the love of the strong and beautiful, is all that
                        is required. The resources of engineering can overcome all difficulties. The
                        quarries border the Nile. The question of transit has already been
                        considered and is reducible to so many piastres per ton.</p>
                    <p>For a government undertaking one can think of no better one than the
                        establishment of vast granite works at Assouan. Egyptian granite as well as
                        Egyptian antiquities, new and old, might find its way into European markets,
                        even as Swedish granite finds its way to England, Scotland, and even Egypt
                        Here, then, is a new Egyptian trade and an unlimited source of revenue.</p>
                    <p>Wanted-a bold renaissance.</p>
                    <p>But as I said, my heart misgives me, and judging from an incident which I
                        witnessed the other day I am dubious as to the robustness of Alexandrian
                        enterprise. Here is an account of the incident A piece of an ancient granite
                        shaft about three metres long and 76 c/m. in diameter was discovered in a
                        foundation, and rather than lift the valuable piece of material out of the
                        trench it was left to lie where it was found and the foundation of the wall
                        across which it lay was arched over it The piece of granite might have been
                        used with effect in, say, a new facade in Cherif Pasha-street. But there it
                        lies buried, the softer material is easier worked and handled. And as we
                        think of the incident the imperative question comes up: If a valuable piece
                        of granite cannot be raised a height of three metres, how can granite be
                        transported for 700 miles? But it could have been done, of course, and done
                        easily.</p>
                    <p>It is in these things we want a renaissance a re-birth of the old love of
                        good work and the fearless handling of material. If I were to say. there is
                        gold in the granite of Assouan, a Klondyke would result. Bat beneath the
                        hard ragged exterior of the Assouan granite there is more than gold—there is
                        beauty and lasting utility. It is matter for the Egyptian Government; for
                        it, there is gold in the granite. The gold is in the pleasant and useful
                        work it will supply to a large part of the ever-increasing population of
                        Egypt.</p>

                    <p>The following is extracted from the P.W;D. Report for 1904:—</p>
                    <p>Gas. 811 new lamps have been added at a cost, of some LE 2.400. This brings
                        the total up to 3.813. This figure is hardly half of that required for the
                        effective lighting of the city, and up to the end of 1904, the high rate
                        changed for gas by the company necessited the suspension of any further
                        extension. In the early days of 1905, however, responsible delegates of the
                        company visited Egypt, and treated direct with the Government. The result
                        has been satisfactory for both parties. The rate for gas has been reduced,
                        an extension of the area has been granted to the company and many of the
                        obscure points in the original concession have been recast and made clear.
                        3,252 lamps were fitted with incandescent burners in 1904—the results have
                        been good.</p>
                    <p>Electricity.—81,3l8lamps(repreeentiagl,R43 private consumers) were connected
                        in 1204, also 141 arc lamps. 1,765 metres of high-ten-sion and 6,639 metres
                        of low-tension cable were laid in 1204. The number of lamps is rapidly
                        increasing. The demand for the current has increased far more rapidly than
                        was expected, and although the generating station was enlarged last year, it
                        has already worked to its full capacity, and the company will be obliged to.
                        erect a new; generating set next year. It has been found, impossible; to
                        obtain any reduction in the price of electricity for private individuals,
                        when altering the convention, at the commencement of this year. The present
                        rate is very high, but the company protests that it is at present unable to
                        reduce it. The existing rate, however, has only been fixed for a period of
                        five years, and it is hoped that, by that time, it may be found possible to
                        reduce the charges made to the public.</p>

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                            Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines
                            are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
                            travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                            without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by
                            P.&amp;O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                            Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                        <head>SICILY.</head>
                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be
                            seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                            The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of
                            S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The
                            Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also
                            worth a visit.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="item">
                        <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.'s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                            springs, change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are
                            at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                            Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio
                            opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio
                            is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake
                            Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
