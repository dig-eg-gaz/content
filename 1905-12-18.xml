                        heave showers of rain alternating with short spells of sunshine.
                        There was a slight gale on Saturday and again on Sunday morning,
                        but in the afternoon the wind dropped, only to rise again at 10
                        p.m., the force of the anemometer reaching 55. Today the weather
                        appears a little more settled but cloudy, with a fresh breeze from
                        the S. Barometer falling.</p>

                    <head>THE CAPITULATIONS.</head>
                    <p>We have never regarded the Capitulations as asorosanot, and recent events
                        have confirmed us in our view that these institutions hav had their day
                        in Egypt. Their existence hase for some time been superfluous, it is now
                        becoming a source of anxiety to all European residents who wish to see 
                        harmonious relations existing between Europeans and the natives of the 
                        country, and has long since irritated all patriotic Egyptians, who cannot 
                        but feel considerable vexation at the difference in the treatment accorded 
                        to the native subject who maltreats a European and the toreign subject who
                        mishandles a native. We have no desire to accuse any nationality, any 
                        consulate, of partiality in its treatment of the cases that arise between
                        natives and Europeans. We recognize that the European officials and 
                        magistrates who at present preside over and compose Consular Courts are
                        an honorable body of men who aim at justice and do their best to be 
                        impervious to external influences. But nothing is gained by blinking out
                        eyes to the fact that these courts have not always given satisfaction, 
                        and that instances could be given where their decisions have been grossly
                        unfair and have been explained at times by the incapacity, at times by the
                        vensility, of judges. What has occurred before may occur again: every 
                        service contains men who are inferior in mental calibre to the bulk of 
                        their colleagues, and it is notorious that even judges of the Consular 
                        Courts have before now incurred suspicion of dishonesty and worse.</p>
                    <p>Let us then put ourselves for a moment in the place of an educated 
                        native of Egypt and consider the Capitulations from his point of view. 
                        Would not our thoughts run much as follows: “I, Mohamed Effendi Selim, 
                        have no quarrel with the men who compose the courts, but I do not see 
                        the necessity for these difference in the treatment of European and 
                        native criminals. My servant’s brother, a silly fellow no doubt, 
                        broke the head of a subject of the King of Lithuania the other day, 
                        and by out law he went to gaol, and very rightly too. But when a 
                        subject of the Prince of Baratavia stabbed the boawab of the house 
                        three doors up the street, who tried to stop him knifing a man in
                        a low café, and the bowab died of his wounds, certain Baratarians 
                        on the jury lent a ready ear to the stories of witnesses whose 
                        proper place was the dock, and the end of it all was that the 
                        foreigner was let off with a ridiculously light sentence. Had he 
                        been a native subject he would have had twenty years. Other 
                        foreigners have been let out on bail when charged with serious 
                        crimes against us and have not been prevented from fleeing the 
                        country and evading justice. Our men, if they break heads or use 
                        knives, go to prison at once. Their trial nowadays comes quickly, 
                        but the subjects of foreign countries wait-free-for months, 
                        during which they may bribe witnesses or leave the country. Even 
                        if the await trial and the proper forms are observed we notice 
                        the difference in the treatment, and if educated men feel as I 
                        do, what is said among the ignorant who do not understand legal 
                        procedure? Why this, that there is one law for the Moslems and 
                        one for the foreigners, that the judges must of a surely be 
                        bribed, and that this is tyranny and injustice. We cannot depend 
                        on the Consular Courts, they must be honest and just one year 
                        but they may disappoint up the next, and the difference in 
                        procedure and in penalties puzzles our lower class. There are 
                        matters for which our laws inflict severer punishments that 
                        theirs, and they do not understand it.”</p>
                    <p>Given such a state of mind, can we wonder that any outbreak of 
                        crime on the part of low-class Europeans against natives leads 
                        to disturbances, for this is not the first time that the Rue 
                        Hamamil and Anastasi-street have seen affrays. Instead of looking 
                        for evidence of fast conspiracies and portentous plots, let us 
                        face the fact that Alexandria contains a multitude of European 
                        and native blackguards and that is the position of the town, 
                        the first seaport of the Levant, makes it impossible to prevent 
                        constant additions to their numbers. “Uno non deficit alter”-you 
                        deport a dozen undesirables and thirteen arrive by the next boat. 
                        Therefore we must hope for the establishment of Courts in which 
                        natives and Europeans will be properly represented on the Bench 
                        and in which, whatever the nationality of the European tried on 
                        a charge of committing a crime against a native, he will be 
                        tried under the same Code and with the same procedure. Otherwise 
                        we must expect dissatisfaction among the natives, and as a large 
                        proportion of them are ignorant men they may be counted upon to 
                        manifest their dissatisfaction by stupid violence. Very regrettable 
                        that they should be stupid and violent, but, my dear objector, 
                        argument has not yet superseded the half-brick at home, and you 
                        show a certain vaivete in deploring the fact in Egypt the argument 
                        of the nabout still survives.</p>

                            COMMENCES.</head>
                        <p>A great deal was witten and said last week as to what might be expected
                            to occur in the city yesterday. How far there was any real ground for
                            alarm must remain a matter of uncertaintv The certainty is that nothing
                            whatever of an untoward character happened. The trial of the natives
                            accused of participation in the late riot proceeded without anything
                            more serioas than a good deal of shooting in the arrest as the vans
                            conveying the prisoners arrived and departed, and nothing worthy of note
                            took place in Rosetta street</p>
                        <p>The authorities are to be commended for the very effective precautions
                            taken against a further riotous outbreak. Mounted polioe pa- trolled the
                            low quarters of the town, and the latest attempt at riot wonld have been
                            suppressed before it could have attained any serions proportions. But so
                            quiet was every neighbor- hood, that a stranger unaware of the history
                            of he last few days would have wondered what the extra display of force
                            meant. We trust that this state of things may continue and that the
                            rowdyism that has been, unfortun- ately, so rife among the lower
                            classes, both European and native, may have received a check that will
                            prove effective in the future.</p>
                        <p>The trial of the persons implicated in the disturbances of Sunday week
                            took plaoe yes- terday morning, in the Native Court. Rosetta- street The
                            court was prodded over by Abl El Megid Bey Fend, and Mahfonz Bey
                            represented the Parquet, Hopkinson Bey, Morice Bey, and Haddaya Bey
                            being present The number of the accused, brought into he court was 104.
                            In the court-yard a crowd of about 200 natives had gathered, and 40
                            policemen were on duty.</p>
                        <p>At half-past eleven the president of the Parquet began his speech for the
                            prosecution, naming the persons suspected of rioting. After giving
                            particulars of the charge against 60 or 7O prisoners, Mahtouz Bey asked
                            the Court to allow 5 minuter respite, and this was granted. On resuming,
                            Mahfeuz Bey contnued reading the long list of accused, making comments
                            as he went on. When the reading of the list had been concluded, the
                            president of ihe Patquet addressed the judge somewhat as follows;—</p>
                        <p>"I trust you are not surprised at the spectacle of 104 persons under
                            trial, as the mob that took part in the disturbance of Sun- day
                            afternoon, of which these persons formed part, numbered 15,000
                            individuals. Indeed, we had not a sufficient number of police to arrest
                            every one who took part in the distur- bance, and that is why the Fire
                            Brigade was re- quisitioned to disperse the thousands of people.
                            Therefore we cannot particularise the circum- stances of the event so
                            far as to report what each of the rioters did. It was some what
                            impossible to do so in such a wide-spread disturbanoe. We arrested 400
                            and after inquiry have discharged 1 half that number. The other haif, i
                            e., the 200 prisoners, were seen by the police and the sheikhs of the
                            quarters to be making a disturbauoe. Had there been witnesses to prove
                            that the other 200 or part of them had taken part in the troubles we
                            should of course have kept them to be tried. Had this disturbance taken
                            plaoe 15 years ago the Court would probably not have found an article in
                            the Penal Code applicable to the present case, for it is only 15 years
                            since Articles 220 and 221 were added to the code, owing to a similar
                            incedent which took place at that time... In short, we have brought
                            these people before you in the hope that they will receive severe
                            punishment to prevent furhter public disturbances. The case was first in
                            the hands of the police, and it then passed into those of the Parquet,
                            and now, the enquiry being oompiete I, beg to lay the case in your
                            hands,trusting you will bear the respon- sibility of giving the proper
                            judgment.”</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the speech for the pro- secution, some discussion
                            took plaoe as to the defence of the prisoners, and finally the hearing
                            was adjourned till next Saturday. The trial of the second batch of 71
                            prisoners took place this morning in the same Court, and was still
                            proceeding as we went to press.</p>

                        <p>Sir Gorell Barnes and Trinity Masters, in die Admiralty Conrt, on
                            Satnrday we k, joncloded the hearing of the oase of the owners if the

                            Clan Camming ind freight. Tbi« was a claim and oonnter- ilaim for
                            damages, owing to a oollision which xoarred between the two vessels in
                            the Suez Banal on September 5 last, resulting in the linking of the
                            Chatham, which oanght fire. 3he wau laden wittyi cargo of 180,' OOlbs.
                            of iyuamite, and 160,600 detonators. The sink- ing of the Chatham
                            leenlted in blocking the Muial traffic for a few days, until, by order
                            of tbeqanal authorities, the vessel was blown np. The aotiou now came
                            before the court for a ieoision as to which of the two vessels was to
                            blame for the oollision.</p>
                        <p>Iu giving judgment his Lordship said that in irder to appreciate the
                            oollision it was ne- sestary to tee how these vessels were aproaoh- ing
                            eaoh othur. Ac the part of the canal where the oollisii-n oconned,
                            vessels proosediug louihwaid had to ‘ tie np” to posts whenever it was
                            neoessaiy for steamers to past np. His Lordship then deait with the
                            rales applying to lse of the searoh-iight and other lighta which iad
                            beeu laid down, m the canal regulations, i’he southern-going vessel must
                            show the iniliant light till ftie pat into the siding, and iben give tbe
                            ordinary light to show she had ;ot iheie. A vessel under enoh
                            oiroumsianoea nuat aot reasonably wheu going south, while !id one going
                            north must watoh and see she lid not get too near the other ship. He
                            thought hat, having regard to the impossiuiiity ot >eiug certain ot the
                            distanoe separating two rcss- Is under these oiroomstanoes, it wa»
                            ibsolutely necessary for the vessel going north- vt>r l to keep herself
                            well in hand, so that she vas oowpletely prepared to deal with any
                            iveutuaheiei she jmght meet from the rhip ouuing south. Sir Gorell
                            Barnes pcin ei out hat each side argued that the other res el had acted
                            in an unreasonable mau- ler, and it was therefore neoe>sary to see vbat
                            really did happen. He had no donbt hat the Chatham was at the time of
                            the oolli- ion practically a stationary ship, and had toted in precisely
                            tin same manner as the had io ed on two previous occasions, wheu she had
                            Irawn up to allow three other vessels to psms. Phe rest of the oa»e was
                            somewhat simple, ieoan«e the collision was a severe ooe, the Han Camming
                            offttug, as she did, right into he bows of the Chatham as iar as the
                            windlass. Phe oely other question was to examine rbe her the Clan
                            Cumining bed proceeded nth proper and reasonable precaution. In his
                            ipmion, and that of the Elder Brethren, those n oharge of the
                            defendanta’ ship did not aot essonably in approach ng the Cuatham,
                            having igued to the ludiQations given to them. The blame for the
                            collision rested solely on the bad lavigation of the Clan Camming, and
                            she must ie louud alone to blame for the oollision.</p>
                        <p>After some little argument the question as o whether the ship was
                            properly blown up was aft for farther oousideration.</p>

                        at Tripoli, it is nevertheless true that the Italian Ambassador at Constantinople was 
                        recently sounded bu the Porte authorities as to whether, in the event of permission 
                        being refused, the mission was likely to land at Alexandria, and from thence penetrate

                    <p>Paris, December 16.</p>
                    <p>Speaking in the Chamber. M. Rouvier said that the Government meant
                        to keep the Morocco question, within proper proportions. He
                        emphasised the foot that France would at the conference uphold
                        her special rights and interests in Morocco. The independence of
                        Morocco and he introduction of reforms were essential, and ‘‘our
                        rights were the result  of negotiations, and if not all recognised
                        , they were at all events all preserved. We calmly await the
                        conference.”</p>
                    <p>Paris, December 16.</p>
                    <p>M. Rouvier stated in the Chamber that France wished to maintain in 
                        Morocco the rights which had been recognised as hers, but she respects
                        the interests of other Powers. The Chamber closured the discussion by
                        401 votes against 51. This vote is considered as an approbation. The
                        session is closed.</p>
                    <p>Paris, December 17.</p>
                    <p>M. Rouvier's speech, which was a firm affirmation of the rights of
                        France as a contiguous and Mussulman Power, produced a marked impression,
                        and was listened to in deep silence, being heartily cheered at the finish.</p>

                    <head>THE PREVENTION OF MALARIA.</head>
                    <p>In reference to our leading article on the subject on Saturday last,
                        the following ex tract from the article on "The Prevention of
                        Malaria,” by Lieut. Col. Giles, in "Climate and Health,” will
                        be of interest;-</p>
                    <p>“In by far the majority of cases we must be content with a partial
                        success all along the line, by adopting such measures as may be
                        locally most practicable. In the case. for example, of habitations
                        placed in the midst of canal irrigation, where ample and efficient
                        subsoil drainage is impossible or too expensive, the attempt to
                        destroy mosquitoes can be little bitter than a waste of time and
                        money, for under such conditions the breeding places are so
                        numerous, and appear so constantly in new and unexpected situations,
                        as to defeat the utmost vigilance, and the thorough protection of
                        all habitations against the invasion of mosquitoes, and the careful
                        treatment of all cases with quinine, is all that can be done.
                        On the other hand, in an exceptional case, such us that of the
                        town of Ismailia in Egypt, where the rainfall is practically nil,
                        and the breeding places all of artificial origin, the practical
                        extermination of mosquitoes may be so easy matter as to be effected
                        at a small expense in a single year, with te immediate  result of
                        reducing the cases of malaria to a  tithe of their previous numbers.”</p>
                    <p>All the world, however, knew or ought to know that Ismailia is the
                        place par Excellence where success attended well-organised effort
                        Under the superintendence of Dr. Presa, of the Canal Company, acting
                        on the advice of Major Ross, what was at one time a hotbed of malaria
                        has now become famous as the town which first conclusively demonstrated
                        the possibility of preventing malaria by clearing out its flag bearer,
                        the mosquito. What has been done in Ismailia bas been done in other
                        places. Let us hope that in our other coastal towns at least and in
                        Cairo the example Ismailia will not be ignored.</p>

                    <p>London, December 9.</p>
                    <p>Major J. L Armitage, 1st Battalion Royal killing Belfast, has gone on
                        retired pay under the age rules. He was a clever and popular regimental
                        officer and hid retirement is mn h regretted. He served with both
                        the 1st and 2nd Battalion* in the South African War, for which he
                        holds the medals, with clasps. As already announced in these notes,
                        he is succeeded in the appointment of second command of the 1st Battalion
                        by Major H O. D. Hiokman from the 2nd Batta-liotn at Cairo. Major Hickman

                        Khedive’s star) was attached to th Egyptian army for some time, when he
                        saw further service in the operations in the Suda , 1888, including the
                        action of G maizah (4 h class Medjidieh, clasp) and he was with the 1st
                        Battalion after on its memorable passage o the way to Ladysmith, including
                        the actions of Belfast and Lydenbnrg (medal with two clasps). Major Hickman
                        is on leave till the 31st inst, when he will assume the duties  of second

                    <p>Major J G. Fair, D.S.O., 21st (Empress of India's) Lanoers, Hounslow, has
                        taken his retired pay after over twenty years’ service in that smart
                        regiment He got his first com-mission in the 21st— then a Hassar regiment
                        —in August, 1885, his troop in 1892, and majority in March, 1900, whilst
                        on active service. major Fair was staff officer to Gatao e at the battle
                        of Atbara, in Kitchener's advance towards Khartoum, and at the battle of
                        Khar-toom he was present in the same capacity (mentioned in despatches,
                        4th class Medjidieh, British medal, and Khedive’s medal with two clasps)
                        He also served in the South African War, earning the D.S.O. and the
                        medal with clasps.</p>
                    <p>Recent changes in the King’s Royal Rifle Corps have brought in Captains
                        D. Blundell H llin hed-Blundell, M.V.O., and R. Sims, D.S.0, on the establishment,
                        to which they were supernumeraries.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant B. G. Bromhead and Sargeant H. Harvey, 1st Battalion Royal Berkshire
                        Regiment, Dublin, passed at the in. the advanced course, including the Maxim gun,
                        at the School of Musketry, Hythe. A note to the official announcement states
                        that ‘the knowledge displayed by Lieutenant Baggalay (11th Hassars) and Lieute-nant
                        Bromhead was of the highest order.” This was in reference to the Maxim gun.</p>
                    <p>The summary of recruiting, just issued by the War Office for 1905,  shows that the
                        results were fairly satisfactory. From 1st January of this year till the 1st October
                        the figures were —cavalry, 2 726 ; artillery 5 745 ; engineers, 703; infantry
                        , 19, 62; departmental corps, 1,386 : total. 29 929. Between the 1st October
                        1905, and the 30th u t 24.557 men enlisted— 21,498 for nine years. 1,073 for twelve
                        years, and the remainder were short-service men. At the present rate enlistment a
                        substantial addition to these figures is anticipated at the end of the year. The
                        new short-service system is doing pretty well in several districts. “Homesters” the
                        recruits are styled in bar racks.</p>
                    <p>The new Premier, Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman, is not a persona grata with the
                        British Army. As a War Secretary in the Galvestonian Administration of 892 he was
                        a Head failure without a single redeeming point and ultimately he blew his party and
                        himself out of office on the cordite question. S cle-verly did he manage things that
                        the stores of that article were almost exhausted, and an adverse vote finished him.
                        But it was reserved for him to be the most vehement traducer of our army during the
                        South African War, when he denounced the army for he “me h ds of barbarism” it pursued
                        in a manner which most have been balm to the feelings of our German cousins. Whilst be
                        and his pro-Boer followers kept the B ers in the field by their delusive speeches, he
                        received many a hearty curse from the brave fellows who were so gallantly keeping the
                        flag flying under the Southern Cross.</p>
                    <p>The Leviathan has been re commissioned at Chatham, with a crew of 891 officers and men,
                        for service on the Mediterranean Station, as flagship of the Third Cruiser Squadron.</p>

                    <head>ARCHITECTURE AND ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                    <p>HOW TO BEAUTIFY THE CITY.</p>
                    <p>BY R. WILLIAMS, F.R.I.B.A.</p>
                    <p>Eves accustomed to architectural forms and details may see, here
                        and there, in odd nooks and corners of Alexandria, many fragments
                        of an older city. Pieces of carved or moulded stone, marble or granite
                        may be found, here as a doorstep, there as a boundary mark, or lying
                        prone on the ground balf-bnried in the duse Occasionally, in digging
                        foundations, the “faes” of the digger strikes a piece of Greek sculpture
                        or a Roman base, or a Byzantine capital, and. now and then, a piece of 
                        a great monolithic shaft is laid bare and anon come to view old culverts, 
                        drains, cisterns, and even cavernous catacombs. Much marble has disappeared 
                        for ever in the kilns of the lime burners and a few fragments, specimens 
                        of the architectural art as practised in ancient Alexandria, 
                        are saved in museums.</p>
                    <p>Alexandria’s Architectural Glories.</p>
                    <p>But fragmentary as all these specimens are, sufficient of them remain to 
                        help us to piece together in our imagination some of the archi-tectural
                        glories of the columnar halls, palaces, temples, and libraries of the 
                        great city of learning founded by Alexander some twenty-two centuries ago. 
                        But all has disappeared under the dust of ages, and.save the fragments which 
                        tell us of artistic labour and of the dauntless courage in overcoming the
                        difficulties of hewing, carving, polishing, and transporting heavy monoliths 
                        a distance of 500 miles from Assouan to the sea, nothing remains. The ancient 
                        grandeur of the city has vanished, its great buildings , enriched with the 
                        work of the artists of its day in hand, enduring material, have fallen a prey, 
                        less to the wear and tear of time, than to the changes and chances of 
                        devastating wars.</p>
                    <p>The Old and the New.</p>
                    <p>Like Heliopolis, marked by its much older and finer monument of antiquity—a 
                        single obelisk—-so is ancient Alexandra marked by its column set up by a 
                        Human proconsul some sixteen hundred years ago. just in time to give it warrant 
                        of antiquity, but very late as times are measured in Egypt. The work of the 
                        proconsul Pompeins towers up in its lone grandeur and strength of foundation, 
                        and if the eyes of the rather roughly cut acanthus leaves of its capital 
                        could have seen. they would have become dim with sorrow as they witnessed how. 
                        one by one, vandal powers filled the columns of the many-pillared halls, 
                        loggias, and arcades that stood around and how, in lieu thereof, town upon 
                        the dust and debris of town arose, and how mounds of “shakf" were formed 
                        by the broken pottery thrown away by succeeding ages of the populations 
                        as they passed down the stream of time, and how by degrees the Alex andria 
                        of to day has arisen—a city of Mex stone, soft brick and plaster—a 
                        renaissance truly, but a mere spectre of the old, ever crumbling and 
                        taming into decay. The old robustness, the bold, spirited handling of 
                        blocks of granite and marble and the drawing thereout, with chisel point
                        and mallet, the beauteous forms which lay hidden therein, have given place
                        to tame ornament in fleeting plaster.</p>
                    <p>Signs of Change.</p>
                    <p>There are, however signs of change, to use words often on the lips of the
                        great artist and man of letters William Morris, and strong hopes, yet 
                        tremulous fears, for art in this prosperous city of Alexandria. The land 
                        of Alexandria is as the land of Ophir, the gold of which was said to be 
                        good. The price of land is becoming fabulous, certain tracts of it, already 
                        high in price, have, in the space of three months, quadrupled, even though 
                        they have lain idle, but this is a property which land possesses all the 
                        world over, where many people are congregated.</p>
                    <p>We may perhaps, take the phenomenal rise in the price of land as a good 
                        augury, deducting therefrom the following  xi m :— The land isn exceed:ngly 
                        valuable, ergo the buildings erected will be highly artistic and of good 
                        material and substantial: and as a corollary we may assume that there may 
                        be at hard the shering in ,of another era of artistic work in Alexandria, 
                        and which permeating all life, shall bring pleasure alike to the designer 
                        and the worker, to the user as well as to the beholder.</p>
                    <p>Improvement of Alexandria,</p>
                    <p>Like other great towns, Berlin, Paris, and London, Alexandria is improving 
                        herself and borders. London has just opened a great new street, cot 
                        through a congeries of small streets at a cost of many millions sterling. 
                        Paris is busy with its underground railway. and in Germany a most excellent 
                        municipal law has been passed whereby municipalities are able to schedule 
                        surrounding lands for the future extension of their cities.</p>
                    <p>Alexandria has its fine tr ct of land partly reclaimed from the sea, and 
                        to the engineers of the Municipality much credit is due for their fine 
                        arrangement of tea wall and double lines of roads. That the elements may 
                        not have the mastery over the materials and construction of the sea wall, 
                        is the prayer of all who have welfare of Alexandra at heart, but of course 
                        time can only tell as to the result. A watchful eye might be kept over the 
                        doings of the waves always bearing in mind that in a wall as well as in 
                        a garment, “a stitch in time saves nine.”</p>
                    <p>Example to our Municipality.</p>
                    <p>Like London with its new street 100 fee wide, Alexandria has in its new 
                        esplanade, an opportunity which comes hot rarely in the why of Municipalities, 
                        and though the London Council may in the main be a worthy model for other 
                        Municipalities, it has, to my mind, committed a grave error in the matter 
                        rf the architecture of its new street. It has shackled the architects with 
                        a style, which it has designated “Palladian Freely Treated” end the result, 
                        thus far, is not altogether satisfactory. Bat there is in the regulations of 
                        the Council of London as to the architecture of the new street a stringent 
                        clause as to materials. These most be of good stone, marble, granite or sound 
                        brick and stone combined. No “stucco” or plastering is to be permitted and 
                        in this the Alexandria Municipality may well follow the London Council.</p>
                    <p>Two questions now arise as to the future architectural development of 
                        Alexandria, and, here, I know fall well that there are plenty of good 
                        men, both native and foreign, who would say to me:—“A fig for your 
                        architectural development, let us have more commercial and monetary 
                        development.” To this, history supplies answers in plenty. To take an 
                        instance The decline of Venice began at a period of great commercial 
                        prosperity in the fifteenth century. Her nobler life and chaster 
                        architectural days had already passed and the force of her energy 
                        was now given up to money-making, giving proof if any were needed, 
                        that the better days of Venice, or of any city, were those of which it, 
                        could be said of the people— that all were for the State and none for 
                        self or party. But this is by the way. Let us come to the two questions 
                        which concern material and style.</p>
                    <p>Material for building.</p>
                    <p>First as to material. Alexandria has no stone save the soft Mex stone 
                        end the native brick, which is also sofa badly burnt The material near 
                        at hand, therefore, is only fit for internal walls, and external walls 
                        covered with plaster. But Egypt abounds in good sandstone, limestone and 
                        red and grey granite. At Tourah there are stones which, if carefully 
                        selected, would make excellent building stone, and in making the section 
                        the analyses made by Mr. A. Lucas, of the Geological Department, Cairo, 
                        will be, if consulted, of the greatest service. Then there is the hard, 
                        compact sand-stone of which many of the ancient temples were built and 
                        which prove its durability This stone may still be ad without stint in 
                        the old quarrie in Upper Egypt.</p>
                    <p>In various parts of the Sudan some good building stones, as that used 
                        with affect in building some of the Sudan railway  stations, as at 
                        Ed Darner, may be found. Above Omdurman in Gebel Awili there is a stone 
                        which, if carefully treated, would make good building stone. Of several samples 
                        of this stone I have had analyses made by a London expert. There need be no 
                        hesitation as to its use in a dry climate, and with treatment of its surface 
                        it may be made to withstand the alternations of wet and dry weather.</p>
                    <p>Stone Preservatives.</p>
                    <p>Further, many of the softer stones and even the better quality of the Mex stone 
                        might be treated with stone preservative, much as in Britain we treat the softer 
                        Bath stone : and here with regard to stone preservatives, I might add that I am 
                        now awaiting the arrival. of samples of five different solutions for the 
                        continuation of experiments already began, with the view of hardening the best 
                        qn^litv of the soft material at hand and so as to free it from its dependence 
                        on stucco. Then as to bricks. There are several ways of making bricks. The sand 
                        at Ramleh might be turned into brick and the brick earth might be better 
                        selected, washed and more thoroughly burned. Lastly, the supply of granite 
                        at Assouan is practically unlimited.</p>
                    <p>Granite from Assouan.</p>
                    <p>Egypt abounds, therefore, in material of which the architect can avail himself 
                        in which to design (shades worthy of the rising prosperity of Alexandria. But 
                        while I write my heart misgives me, and the question occurs •— Is there public 
                        spirit and enterprise enough in Alexandria or-in Egypt to undertake the quarrying 
                        working and transporting of granite from Assonan to Alexandria, and of course to 
                        all towns by the way? The granite is there in great masses. The apparently vast 
                        quantity used for the great dam 2,000 metres long by 37 metres high, has left no 
                        appreciable difference in the vast store awaiting the tool of the worker.</p>
                    <p>Determination, coupled with the love of the strong and beautiful, is all that 
                        is required. The resources of engineering can overcome all difficulties. The 
                        quarries border the Nile. The question of transit has already been considered 
                        and is reducible to so many piastres per ton.</p>
                    <p>For a government undertaking one can think of no better one than the establishment 
                        of vast granite works at Assouan. Egyptian granite as well as Egyptian antiquities, 
                        new and old, might find its way into European markets, even as Swedish granite 
                        finds its way to England, Scotland, and even Egypt Here, then, is a new Egyptian 
                        trade and an unlimited source of revenue.</p>
                    <p>Wanted-a bold renaissance.</p>
                    <p>But as I said, my heart misgives me, and judging from an incident which I witnessed 
                        the other day I am dubious as to the robustness of Alexandrian enterprise. Here is 
                        an account of the incident A piece of an ancient granite shaft about three metres 
                        long and 76 c/m. in diameter was discovered in a foundation, and rather than lift 
                        the valuable piece of material out of the trench it was left to lie where it was 
                        found and the foundation of the wall across which it lay was arched over it The 
                        piece of granite might have been used with effect in, say, a new facade in Cherif 
                        Pasha-street. But there it lies buried, the softer material is easier worked and 
                        handled. And as we think of the incident the imperative question comes up: If a 
                        valuable piece of granite cannot be raised a height of three metres, how can 
                        granite be transported for 700 miles? But it could have been done, of course, 
                        and done easily.</p>
                    <p>It is in these things we want a renaissance a re-birth of the old love of good work
                        and the fearless handling of material. If I were to say. there is gold in the 
                        granite of Assouan, a Klondyke would result. Bat beneath the hard ragged exterior 
                        of the Assouan granite there is more than gold—there is beauty and lasting 
                        utility. It is matter for the Egyptian Government; for it, there is gold in 
                        the granite. The gold is in the pleasant and useful work it will supply to a 
                        large part of the ever-increasing population of Egypt.</p>

                    <p>THE LIGHTING OF CAIRO.</p>
                    <p>The following is extracted from the P.W;D. Report for 1904:—</p>
                    <p>Gas. 811 new lamps have been added at a cost, of some LE 2.400. This brings the total 
                        up to 3.813. This figure is hardly half of that required for the effective lighting 
                        of the city, and up to the end of 1904, the high rate changed for gas by the company 
                        necessited the suspension of any further extension. In the early days of 1905, however,
                        responsible delegates of the company visited Egypt, and treated direct with the 
                        Government. The result has been satisfactory for both parties. The rate for gas has 
                        been reduced, an extension of the area has been granted to the company and many of 
                        the obscure points in the original concession have been recast and made clear. 3,252 
                        lamps were fitted with incandescent burners in 1904—the results have been good.</p>
                    <p>Electricity.—81,3l8lamps(repreeentiagl,R43 private consumers) were connected in 1204, 
                        also 141 arc lamps. 1,765 metres of high-ten-sion and 6,639 metres of low-tension cable 
                        were laid in 1204. The number of lamps is rapidly increasing. The demand for the current 
                        has increased far more rapidly than was expected, and although the generating station was 
                        enlarged last year, it has already worked to its full capacity, and the company will be 
                        obliged to. erect a new; generating set next year. It has been found, impossible; to 
                        obtain any reduction in the price of electricity for private individuals, when altering 
                        the convention, at the commencement of this year. The present rate is very high, but 
                        the company protests that it is at present unable to reduce it. The existing rate, 
                        however, has only been fixed for a period of five years, and it is hoped that, by that 
                        time, it may be found possible to reduce the charges made to the public.</p>

                    <p>Les télégrammes de Londres signalent une nouvelle hausse du taux 
                        d’escompte, porté de 3 ’/2 à 4 0/0. C’et une élévation de 5/8 
                        e-deux j eurs. On s’était décidément trop hâ é d’àbaîscer le 
                        loyer de l’argent à un nivean que justifiait sans douta une 
                        aisance renaissante, mais que ne conseillait peut-être pas la 
                        situation générale.</p>
                    <p>Le Consolidé anglais a perdu encore 1/8 à 83 1 /8 ; mais les valeurs 
                        égyptiennes ont conservé leurs prix de la veille.</p>
                    <p>A Paris, le Crédit Foncier a regagné 2 francs à 772.</p>
                    <p>loi, ee matin, le marché a été assez enimf. L’Agricole est plus

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                            accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                            they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                            accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                            are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                            things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                            between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                            Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                            than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                            the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                            place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                            sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                            the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>

                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                            London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                            Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                            also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                            Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                            without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                            in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                            line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                            Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                            express from Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                            is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                            responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                            deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                            fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                            Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                            />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                            been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                            If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                            at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                            arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                            London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers which
                            leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                            of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                            station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                            occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                            visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                            CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                            Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                            the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                            history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                            413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                            is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                            Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                            Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                            Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                            visit.</p>

                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                            during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s
                            steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                            wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                            [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                            devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                            portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                            to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                            brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                            and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                            excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                            fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                            finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                            hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                            Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                            level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                            thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                            takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                            Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                            possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                            sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                            and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                            house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                            and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                            the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                            a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                            breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                            constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                            Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                            marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                            filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                            illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                            cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                            change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                            bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                            approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                            The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                            behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                            the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                            out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                            hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                            beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
