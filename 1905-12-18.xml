                            COMMENCES.</head>
                        <p>A great deal was witten and said last week as to what might be expected
                            to occur in the city yesterday. How far there was any real ground for
                            alarm must remain a matter of uncertaintv The certainty is that nothing
                            whatever of an untoward character happened. The trial of the natives
                            accused of participation in the late riot proceeded without anything
                            more serioas than a good deal of shooting in the arrest as the vans
                            conveying the prisoners arrived and departed, and nothing worthy of note
                            took place in Rosetta street</p>
                        <p>The authorities are to be commended for the very effective precautions
                            taken against a further riotous outbreak. Mounted polioe pa- trolled the
                            low quarters of the town, and the latest attempt at riot wonld have been
                            suppressed before it could have attained any serions proportions. But so
                            quiet was every neighbor- hood, that a stranger unaware of the history
                            of he last few days would have wondered what the extra display of force
                            meant. We trust that this state of things may continue and that the
                            rowdyism that has been, unfortun- ately, so rife among the lower
                            classes, both European and native, may have received a check that will
                            prove effective in the future.</p>
                        <p>The trial of the persons implicated in the disturbances of Sunday week
                            took plaoe yes- terday morning, in the Native Court. Rosetta- street The
                            court was prodded over by Abl El Megid Bey Fend, and Mahfonz Bey
                            represented the Parquet, Hopkinson Bey, Morice Bey, and Haddaya Bey
                            being present The number of the accused, brought into he court was 104.
                            In the court-yard a crowd of about 200 natives had gathered, and 40
                            policemen were on duty.</p>
                        <p>At half-past eleven the president of the Parquet began his speech for the
                            prosecution, naming the persons suspected of rioting. After giving
                            particulars of the charge against 60 or 7O prisoners, Mahtouz Bey asked
                            the Court to allow 5 minuter respite, and this was granted. On resuming,
                            Mahfeuz Bey contnued reading the long list of accused, making comments
                            as he went on. When the reading of the list had been concluded, the
                            president of ihe Patquet addressed the judge somewhat as follows;—</p>
                        <p>"I trust you are not surprised at the spectacle of 104 persons under
                            trial, as the mob that took part in the disturbance of Sun- day
                            afternoon, of which these persons formed part, numbered 15,000
                            individuals. Indeed, we had not a sufficient number of police to arrest
                            every one who took part in the distur- bance, and that is why the Fire
                            Brigade was re- quisitioned to disperse the thousands of people.
                            Therefore we cannot particularise the circum- stances of the event so
                            far as to report what each of the rioters did. It was some what
                            impossible to do so in such a wide-spread disturbanoe. We arrested 400
                            and after inquiry have discharged 1 half that number. The other haif, i
                            e., the 200 prisoners, were seen by the police and the sheikhs of the
                            quarters to be making a disturbauoe. Had there been witnesses to prove
                            that the other 200 or part of them had taken part in the troubles we
                            should of course have kept them to be tried. Had this disturbance taken
                            plaoe 15 years ago the Court would probably not have found an article in
                            the Penal Code applicable to the present case, for it is only 15 years
                            since Articles 220 and 221 were added to the code, owing to a similar
                            incedent which took place at that time... In short, we have brought
                            these people before you in the hope that they will receive severe
                            punishment to prevent furhter public disturbances. The case was first in
                            the hands of the police, and it then passed into those of the Parquet,
                            and now, the enquiry being oompiete I, beg to lay the case in your
                            hands,trusting you will bear the respon- sibility of giving the proper
                            judgment.”</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the speech for the pro- secution, some discussion
                            took plaoe as to the defence of the prisoners, and finally the hearing
                            was adjourned till next Saturday. The trial of the second batch of 71
                            prisoners took place this morning in the same Court, and was still
                            proceeding as we went to press.</p>

                        <head>CLAN CUMMING HELD RESPONSIBLE.</head>
                        <p>Sir Gorell Barnes and Trinity Masters, in die Admiralty Conrt, on
                            Satnrday we k, joncloded the hearing of the oase of the owners if the
                            Chatham and her crew, suing for loss of fffeotH, v. the owners i f the
                            Clan Camming ind freight. Tbi« was a claim and oonnter- ilaim for
                            damages, owing to a oollision which xoarred between the two vessels in
                            the Suez Banal on September 5 last, resulting in the linking of the
                            Chatham, whioh oanght fire. 3he wau laden wittyi cargo of 180,' OOlbs.

                            leenlted in blocking the Muial traffic for a few days, until, by order
                            of tbeqanal authorities, the vessel was blown np. The aotiou now came
                            before the court for a ieoision as to whioh of the two vessels was to
                            blame for the oollision.</p>
                        <p>Iu giving judgment his Lordship said that in irder to appreciate the
                            oollision it was ne- sestary to tee how these vessels were aproaoh- ing
                            eaoh othur. Ac the part of the canal where the oollisii-n oconned,
                            vessels proosediug louihwaid had to ‘ tie np” to posts whenever it was
                            neoessaiy for steamers to past np. His Lordship then deait with the
                            rales applying to lse of the searoh-iight and other lighta whioh iad
                            beeu laid down, m the canal regulations, i’he southern-going vessel must
                            show the iniliant light till ftie pat into the siding, and iben give tbe
                            ordinary light to show she had ;ot iheie. A vessel under enoh
                            oiroumsianoea nuat aot reasonably wheu going south, while !id one going
                            north must watoh and see she lid not get too near the other ship. He
                            thought hat, having regard to the impossiuiiity ot >eiug certain ot the
                            distanoe separating two rcss- Is under these oiroomstanoes, it wa»
                            ibsolutely necessary for tbe vessel going north- vt>r l to keep herself
                            well in hand, so that she vas oowpletely prepared to deal with any
                            iveutuaheiei she jmght meet from the rhip ouuing south. Sir Gorell
                            Barnes pcin ei out hat each side argued that the other res el had acted
                            in an unreasonable mau- ler, and it was therefore neoe>sary to see vbat
                            really did happen. He had no donbt hat the Chatham was at the time of
                            the oolli- ion practically a stationary ship, and had toted in precisely
                            tin same manner as the had io ed on two previous occasions, wheu she had
                            Irawn up to allow three other vessels to psms. Phe rest of the oa»e was
                            somewhat simple, ieoan«e the collision was a severe ooe, the Han Camming
                            offttug, as she did, right into he bows of the Chatham as iar as the
                            windlass. Phe oely other question was to examine rbe her the Clan
                            Cumining bed proceeded nth proper and reasonable precaution. In his
                            ipmion, and that of the Elder Brethren, those n oharge of the
                            defendanta’ ship did not aot essonably in approach ng the Cuatham,
                            having igued to the ludiQations given to them. The blame for the
                            collision rested solely on the bad lavigation of the Clan Camming, and
                            she must ie louud alone to blame for the oollision.</p>
                        <p>After some little argument the question as o whether the ship was
                            properly blown up was aft for farther oousideration.</p>
