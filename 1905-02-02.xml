                        receive a deputation of workmen at Tsarkoe Seto. Except at Warsaw, where
                        there is will considerable torment; the Russian provinces seem to be
                        generally settling down. Well-informed persons believe, however, that the
                        effects on the movement will be lasting, as it shows a remarkable ana
                        unsuspected vitality of co-operation among the Russian masses, which is
                        likely to manage itself whenever occasion arises. The deputation to the Tsar
                        numbered 34. They were accompanied by Generals Kokovstself aud Trepott. The
                        Tsar said that the incident, the deplorable consequences of which were
                        inevitable as the result of disorder, were due to the workmen permitting
                        themselves to be misled by traitors. Strikes and demonstrations constantly
                        resulted in disorders which must always no repressed by troops, He
                        recognised that the workmen's lives were not easy, but they must be patient.
                        It was a crime to come in crowds to declare their needs to him. He promised
                        to take measures to amenorate their lot and to assure a legal examination of
                        their demands. The Tsar concluded: —"1 pardon your transgression. Return to
                        work and do your duty." (Reuter.)</p>

                    <head>RAMLEH RAILWAY COMPANY. THE CITY EXTENSION.</head>
                    <p>A number of complaints have lately been made by the public against the
                        Alexandria and Ramleh Railway Company on the subject of the want of
                        accommodation at the temporary terminus of the line at Alexandria. Owing to
                        the recent bad weather these complaints became very rife, because there was
                        no shelter at all at the terminus. The company, it is only just to state,
                        has for some months past been urging the Alexandria Municipality to grant
                        provisionally permission to make a turning-point (bonde) and a shelter for
                        passengers at the new terminus in order that the trams should not have to
                        wait, and that thereby accident might be avoided. The compauy asked that
                        this request should be granted until some decision was arrived at on the
                        subject of the new city terminus in Mohamed Aly-square. The Municipality
                        refused to consider the question unless the company gave them a supervisory
                        control over the line in the interests of the publics. But according to the
                        company’s concession this control was vetted in the Egyptian Government, and
                        the board of directors of the compauy has no power to resign this right to
                        the Municipality, as it is the fundamental part of the concession. At the
                        present moment, therefore, the state of affairs is as follows. The
                        Municipality has given the company the power to extend the line to the
                        square according to the contract for the cession of the land for extending
                        the Ramleh-boulevard. But the Municipality has not yet come to any decision
                        as to the actual terminus of the proposed extension of the line into the
                        city. In the meantime it refuses to let the company make a provisional
                        terminus by the old station. The inconvenience resulting from this state of
                        things is obvious, and it is sincerely to be hoped that the Municipality
                        will find some means to solve the difficulty.</p>

                    <p><placeName>Shebin-el-Kom,</placeName> January 30. For a long time past the
                        traffic to Tantah on the Ashmonn-Tantah line has been very heavy, especially
                        on Fridays and Mondays, when large numbers of the fellaheen visit Tantah for
                        the purpose of praying in the famous Mosque of Sidi Ahmed el-Bedawi. To
                        provide for this heavy traffic, the Administration in the begin-ing of the
                        year put on a 3rd-claas special train. This was a great boon to the
                        inhabitants of this province also as it gave them an opportunity of joining
                        the express to Cairo and Alexandria at Tantah at 9 am. For some reason or
                        other, this train has now been discontinued, and in its place an engine and
                        three carriages have been added to the ordinary train which leaves Ashmoun
                        at 8.40 am. for Tantah and returns from Tantah at 6.30 pm. Therefore anyone
                        travelling from Ashmoun or any intermediate station with the intention of
                        going on to Alexandria or Cairo, must sleep at Tantah all night if be
                        desires to reach his destination at an early hour in order to transact his
                        business and return the same day. The Administration is increasing it
                        expenditure without increasing the utility of the line so for as the
                        passengers are concerned. We would draw the attention of the Administration
                        to this matter, and urge it to run the extra carriage and engine as a
                        special train starting from Ashmoun at 6 a.m. in the morning and returning
                        from Tantah at 4.40 pm.</p>

                        sanctioning motor bases in Alexandria, to draw up an elaborate set of
                        regulations for strict observance by the concessionaire company who propose
                        to start the innovation. Unless most careful rules and regulations are made,
                        our main roads will be unsafe for man or beast,and cabs and private
                        carriages will be driven from the streets by the instinct of
                        self-preservation. For as matters at present stand anybody can be a driver
                        of a motor and there is no system of examination or licenses for chauffeurs.
                        It is appalling to contemplate the results of a service of rapid motor bases
                        careering wildly through the busiest parts of the city coder the guidance of
                        irresponsible native driven. We are decidedly in favour of a motor bus

                        great boon to the city and suburbs, but before sanctioning it the
                        Municipality ought to impose the most strongest conditions with a view to

                        parts—was most creditable. Signora Svicher was as wonderful as ever, and she
                        added to her lustre by a special performance of a fantasia by Offenbach. We
                        may say at once that her mastery over this (and, we under stand, other
                        instruments) is fully as great as that over her voice. The “harmonics" were
                        extraordinary, not merely as a “tour de force” bet for delicacy and tone. It
                        is not given to every cellist to prodoce faultless violin effects on a
                        violoncello ; therein not merely skill but also a considerable knowledge of
                        music is involved. And the rest of her playing was artistic, quiet, and
                        indeed thoroughly admirable. We understand that the company will, after
                        their present visit to Alexandria, return to Cairo, and that, among the
                        pieces to be given, Mignon will figure. We have, in these columns, said much
                        about the excellence of the Verdi Theatre, and unfortunately have had
                        occassion to compare it with the Khedivial Opera, most unfavorably (but
                        deservedly so) as for as the latter is concerned. The Verdi Theatre has
                        given us Signora Svicher and Signori Tomisani, Bal-delli, and Badini, four
                        singers of unusual merit. And we sincerely hope that the company will, on
                        their return, meet with a more appreciative—we bad almost said less churlish
                        —reception, and that Cairo may bo induced by experience to believe that
                        opera (and good opera) may be obtainable independently of abonnement and
                        State subsidy. To conclude, we may hazard a prophecy that if the Compagnia
                        Lirica is appreciated and remunerated according to its undoubted deserts, it
                        will be enabled thereby to afford a chorus and general ensemble worthy to
                        support and enhance the merits of its excellent “principals.” We quite agree
                        with the “Journal du Caire” that the chorus and staging of the Khedivial
                        Theatre beyond reproach. The orchestra is not so much so, witness the
                        Tristan et Isolde, though it is numerous and well organised. Naturally the
                        one theatre can and the other oannot indulge in these luxurious necessities.
                        And once more we repeat that the Verdi Theatre management deserve the
                        highest possible praise for the good work they have done. That they should
                        be at all comparable with, not to say at time* better than, the Khedivial
                        Theatre is the best possible testimony to the excellence of that work.</p>

                        the tables being engaged. Yesterday evening. Sir Ernest Camel entertained a

                        Colebrooke. At another table we noticed Mr. W. Heaton Armstrong and a party,
                        including Mr. Machell. Maitie Carton de Wiart, the Hon. 0. Murray, Master of

                        who has come to Egypt as one of Sir Ernest Cassel’s party, prior to once
                        more taking up the role of political hostess, proposes daring the coming
                        session, it is. reported, to revive the party salon of a generation or so
                        ago; convinced that so far at least as the Liberal cause is concerned,
                        society is not rendering to politics its full meed of duty. It is something
                        over two years ago that Sir Edward and Lady Colebrooke first opened the
                        doors of their charming house in Stratford-place to the liberal League with
                        Lord Rossbery as the lion of the evening. As a political hostess, Lady
                        Colebrooke was a signal success as she has always been in a purely social
                        sense, for she has wit, sympathy, and beauty. Lady Colebrooke is a daughter
                        of the late Lord Alfred Paget, and is a cousin of the Marquess of Anglesey.
                        The King and Queen stood sponsors at her christening, and attended her
                        marriage in 1889. Sir Edward, who is forty-three or thereabouts, is the
                        fifth baronet of a creation of 1759; and is the owner of some thirty
                        thousand acres. Among the passengers for Egypt by the “Marmora" is Mr. H. T.
                        Anstruther, who is bound for Ismailia. He is one of the official directors
                        of the Suez Canal Company and will take part in the annual inspection of the
                        canal by the directors. He is accompanied by his wife, the Hon. Mrs.
                        Anstiuther, who is a daughter of the 4th Baron Sudely. Boutros Pasha Ghali,
                        Mr. Malcolm Mellwraith, M. de Rocca Serra, and M. Bernardi left Cairo last
                        night to attend the last meeting ot the technical commission or the Mixed
                        Tribunals. The marriage of Neghib Bey Fehmy, the son of Scandar Pasha Fehmy,
                        to Miss Abontxia was celebrated at Zeitoun on Tuesday. We regret to lean
                        that Miss Friend, eldest daughter of Mr. E. C. Friend, of Max, had a nasty
                        fall while out riding, and dislocated her right elbow. She is, however,
                        progressing satisfactorily. Dr. Giffen, American missionary in the Sudan, is
