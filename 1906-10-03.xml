                    <head>THE SINAITIC DELIMITATION.</head>
                    <p>Shortly before we went to press yesterday afternoon we received a telephonic
                        message from our Cairo correspondent to say that the treaty concerning the
                        delimitation of the Sinaitic eastern boundary had been signed. By this
                        successful termination of a dispute, which at one point necessitated a
                        forcible naval demonstration by the British navy, Egypt, thanks to British
                        support and to the justice of her case—emerges with success from a
                        diplomatic combat which might have had serious consequences, and the
                        satisfaction of the authorities can only be heightened by the difficulty
                        with which this happy end has been attained. </p>
                    <p>In itself the Sinai is of no importance—a waterless and rugged region,
                        frequented only <cb n="6"/>by antiquarians and Bedouins; it offered no prize
                        to the contending parties in the recent negotiations. But as the gate of
                        Egypt possessed enormous strategical importance That arid triangle of sand
                        and rocks with its base on the Mediterranean and its apex on the Red Sea has
                        been traversed by most of the conquerors of Egypt. The Hyksos, the army of
                        “barbarians” that marched from Western Asia against the third Rameses passed
                        through it. The Egyptian conquerors of Syria followed the famous road from
                        Pelusium to Gaza, and in later days, when the Assyrian and Babylonian kings
                        avenged themselves on the Pharaohs, Sargon won a victory at Rafah—where
                        Ptolemies and Selucids, Mamelukes and Mongols were to fight, and Turks and
                        Egyptians to wrangle—and Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal, Nebuchadnezzer, and
                        last of all the Persian conquerors under Cambyses invaded unhappy Egypt by
                        this route. The pageant of Arab conquerors, Mameluke kings, crusading
                        raiders, and great captains who marched over its sands is fitly closed by
                        the names of Ibrahim Pasha and Napoleon Bonaparte. </p>
                    <p>Need it then surprise even the most hardened advocate of "peace at any price”
                        that the discovery that the Hedjaz railway had enabled the Turks to bring
                        their troops from the Syrian garrison towns to within striking distance of
                        the frontier by a new route, hitherto unknown to the annals of military
                        history, caused a certain uneasiness to the British and Egyptian Governments
                        ; that the strange demand of Ghazi Mukhtar Pasha aggravated this uneasiness
                        and that the Moslem population of Egypt—divided between Khalif and
                        Khedive—showed for almost the first time a keen, if credulous, interest in a
                        question of external politics and a disquiet that Lord Cromer has
                        characterised as natural enough. The British Government rose to the
                        occasion. It wisely increased the garrison of Egypt while strengthening the
                        hand of the Egyptian Foreign Office by vigorous diplomatic support, and
                        thanks to its intervention an amicable basis of agreement was at last
                        discovered through the application of an ultimatum—not the first which the
                        Ottoman Empire has received from a foreign power, nor, we daresay, the last. </p>
                    <p>The diplomatic struggle has been fruitful in results. The British colony in
                        Egypt has learnt who are the foes and who the friends of the British
                        Occupation. They have realised that there are cases in which it is naïveté,
                        and childish naïveté, to expect that a doubtful gratitude for benefits
                        conferred will outweigh religious and political prejudice. They have learned
                        that the great majority of the Europeans resident in Egypt, all the wiser
                        and more cautious among the Moslems, and, with trifling exceptions, the
                        Syrians and the Copts are with them : they have also learned the strength
                        and fathomed the motives of the leaders of the opposition which is directed
                        against not only alone British but against all European influence and
                        control, and they have been able to guess the origin of the agitation
                        steadily and often skilfully fomented by highly placed intriguers both
                        within Egypt and without. Moreover they know now that Egypt is not
                        invulnerable and though the successful delimitation of the frontier has
                        removed all immediate danger they realise the truth of the proverb
                        “Forewarned is forearmed.” It is our earnest hope that the home Government
                        will be as prompt as its distinguished representative in Egypt in grasping
                        the full significance of the Tabah incident and its sequel. </p>
                    <p>H.H. the Khedive and Ghazi Mukhtar Pasha, who have just returned, will no
                        doubt be delighted to find that a possible cause of dispute between Egypt
                        and the Suzerain Power has been removed. The frontier line will appear on
                        future atlases as a straight line drawn from Rafah to a point a little to
                        the N.W. of the head of the Gulf of Akaba and will then terminate with a
                        semicircular sweep half way up the Nakhl el Akaba and back to the sea at Ras
                        Tabah. From Rafah it passes through the country of the Sawarka Bedouin,
                        crosses the hill of Ras el Ain and leaving Birein wells on the Turkish side
                        passes six miles east of the wells and stream of Ain Kadeis (Kadesh Barnea)
                        and 14 miles east of Kuseima, past Thamilet Sueilma to Ras Radadi, a spur
                        jutting from the edge of the Sinaitic plateau and close to the Nakhl el
                        Akaba, the upper portion of which with the post of Mufrak remains in
                        Egyptian hands. Then the frontier sweeps down into the plain to the Tabah
                        cape. The concession of a small area near Akaba should relieve the Ottoman
                        Government of the anxiety which it professed to cherish as to Egyptian and
                        British designs on Akaba and indirectly on the Hedjaz railway. </p>
                    <p>Our Nationalists may claim it as a triumph for the Khalif: they may do so if
                        it pleases them, for no one will be a penny the worse, and we cannot help
                        thinking that in a few years’ time relations between Great Britain and the
                        Turkish Empire will be enormously improved, and that the evidence furnished
                        by the agreement that England neither has any designs in Petræa nor intends
                        to use Egypt as a catspaw should calm the fears of the more reasonable among
                        Osmanli Anglophobes. We offer our hearty congratulations to the Egyptian
                        Government and to Lord Cromer, Mr. M. de C. Findlay, and the other members
                        of the British Agency, whose diplomatic support and energetic but patient
                        conduct of delicate negotiations has met with such success. High praise is
                        also due to Ibrahim Pasha Fathi and to Major R. Owen and their staff for the
                        patience with which they surveyed, argued, and negotiated. The two
                        commissioners are not yet back from Rafah after an absence of close on
                        eighteen weeks in a region which has not improved since the Israelites—much
                        against the grain—wandered over its wastes. They have established excellent
                        relations with the Turkish frontier officers, and the final success of their
                        labours will compensate them for an arduous task admirably carried out. </p>
