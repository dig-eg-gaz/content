                    <head>OBITUARY. MAITRE PAUL RUELENS.</head>
                    <p>We deeply regret to announce the death of Maitre Paul Ruelens, the well-known
                        Belgian- barrister of the Mixed Court of Appeal at Alexandria. The deceased
                        had to relinquish a large and lucrative practice at the Bar in December,
                        1903, owing to dropsy. The malady confined him to his house for the past
                        seventeen months. About three weeks ago he became dangerously ill and
                        succumbed yes- terday afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Maitre Reulens was born on March 14, 1849, at Brussels, where his father held
                        the post of chief librarian to the Belgian National Library. He was educated
                        at the University of Brussels and was called to the Bar there in 1872. In
                        1885 he came out to Egypt, where he soon obtained an excellent legal
                        practice. He had a profound knowledge of law and was a very clever advocate,
                        being often appealed to by bis follow barristers for advice on difficult
                        points of law. He was very popular in his own profession, and his geniality
                        and goodness of heart endeared him to a large circle of friends.</p>
                    <p>We beg to tender our sincere sympathies to his widow and only son; M. Charles
                        Ruelens, in their bereavement. The funeral took place this morning.</p>

                    <p>H.H. the Khedive left Cairo at 7.45 o'clock this morning for Alexandria.
                        Guards of honor chosen from the Egyptian Army and the Army of Occupation
                        were present at the station to pay the usual honors, and the Railway Ad-
                        ministration had taken great pains to decorate the interior and exterior of
                        the station build- ings with excellent results. A great number of prominent
                        officials and notables, with many re- presentatives of the Press, were
                        present, besides all the Ministers, the Advisers and Under Secretaries of
                        State, heads of departments, etc.</p>
                    <p>His Highness arrived at the station from Koubbeh by special train shortly
                        after half- past seven and immediately left the train, standing for some
                        time on the platform, convers- ing with the Ministers and Advisers, and many
                        of the notables present.</p>
                    <p>The guards of honor were drawn up within the station, the Inniskillings on
                        one platform and the Egyptian troops on the other, and the Khedivial salute
                        was given as his Highness entered and left the station, a salute of 21 guns
                        being fired from the Citadel as the train steamed out.</p>
                    <p>Major Blakeney, R.E., and Messrs. Cotterill, Peacock, and Trevithick
                        travelled in the Khedivial train, which arrived at the Mohar- rem Bey
                        terminus punctually to the minute at 11.30 o'clock, and a salute of 21 guns
                        from Kom el Dik announced the arrival of the train. The station had been
                        very tastefully decorated in honor of the occasion and there was a beautiful
                        display of shrubs and bunting. A large and representative gathering of Euro-
                        pean and native notables were assembled on the platform to greet his
                        Highness, who on detraining, walked up the platform, cordially shaking many
                        of those present by the hand.</p>
                    <p>Outside the station a guard of honor of Egyptian troops, composed of 100
                        non-commis- sioned officers aud men, the battalion colour, and the Infantry
                        band, was paraded, and a similar guard of honor from the British garrison
                        was also paraded.</p>
                    <p>The Khedive, on leaving the station,inspect- ed the two guards of honor and
                        then drove off to Ras-el-Tin Palace, escorted by his body guard. The streets
                        on the line of route to the Palace were gaily decorated with flags and
                        bunting, and Cherif Pasha-street presented a most animated appearance.</p>
                    <p>The Khedive was accompanied by his Ministers and the members of his
                        household.</p>

                    <p>When the pilgrims reached a station called “Al Kamra," on the morning of the
                        day in question, the soldiers went to the market, which contains 700
                        Bedouins, all well armed. One of the soldiers bought a packet of tobacco
                        from a Bedouin but would not give him the price asked for. The Bedouin
                        hesitated to give the soldier the packet of tobacco, and the latter
                        thereupon became irritated, and gave the Bedouin a blow which threw him to
                        the ground. The Bedouin got up and gave the soldier a beating which injured
                        him severely. Afterwards the Bedouins took up a position behind the hills,
                        and firing ensued between the two sides for two hours. The losses were 26
                        soldiers injured, 4 killed, and 10 pilgrims, 6 horses, and 12 camels killed.
                        Ten or twelve Bedouins were injured.</p>

                    <head>MOHAMED ALY MEMORIAL. THE MADHOUSE SCHEME.</head>
                    <p>A correspondent writes :—</p>
                    <p>"The idea of celebrating the centenary of the founder of the Khedivial
                        Dynasty, and of a man who was undoubtedly one of the great figures of
                        history during the past century, by the construction of a madhouse, is
                        decidedly original, and the originator of the scheme deserves to be warmly
                        congratulated on his sense of humour. It is stated by the advocates of the
                        project that speculation is so much on the increase at Alexandria, and has
                        taken such a strong hold on all classes, that if a crash did come, the
                        existing accommodation for the insane in the Government Hospital, would be
                        ridiculously small to accommodate the vast number of lunatics who would be
                        thrown upon the town.</p>
                    <p>"The prospect is not a pleasing one to con- template, and it is sincerely to
                        be hoped that the awful eventuality may not come to pass. But even if a
                        crash were likely to fill the streets with crowds of maddened speculators, I
                        fail to see that there is any necessity for such an inappropriate memorial
                        to the great Pasha as a madhouse. The Government is considering the
                        construction of a large lunatic asylum; plans are now being prepared, and
                        although the site has not yet been chosen, it will in all probability be
                        situated somewhere between Alexandria and Cairo. Why then should
                        Alexandrians go out of their way to subscribe for an institution which ought
                        to be undertaken by the Government, and when we know that the foundation of
                        such an asylum is now under consideration by the Government? In memorials,
                        dependent on public subscript- tions, it is one of the essentials of success
                        that the object for which the subscribers’ donations are asked should strike
                        the imagination to a certain degree and also be appropriate, quâ memorial,
                        to the man in whose honor it is erected. Why then a madhouse? Surely many
                        other far more attractive memorials could be found, such for instance as a
                        public library?”</p>

                    <head>IRISH DINNER AT CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>An "Irish dinner" was held on Tuesday night at Shepheard’s Hotel and was a
                        great success in every way, the arrangements, decora- tions, and menu being
                        greatly appreciated by all who were present. The chair was taken by Johnson
                        Pasha, and among the Irishmen who took part in the dinner were Dr. Keatinge,
                        Mr. Verschoyle, Col. Atkinson, Major Donegan, Mr. Adams, Mr. Stokes, Mr.
                        Macloughlin, Mr. Langley, Mr. Weldon (to whose excellent arrangements much
                        of the success of the evening was due), Mr. Villiers-Stuart, Mr. Young, Mr.
                        O'Sullivan, and many others.</p>
                    <p>After the usual loyal and patriotic toasts had been honored, speeches were
                        delivered by the chairman and a large proportion of the Irishmen present,
                        and were received with un- animous applause. It was decided to form an Irish
                        Dinner Club, which should meet every St Patrick's Day, and all present bound
                        them- selves to spare no pains to obtain Irish recruits. Mr. Langley was
                        elected nem. con. to the pre- sidency of the club, Mr. Weldon being un-
                        animously chosen as secretary.</p>
                    <p>The communicative glow which illumined the banquet was so dazzling as to make
                        any account of the many speeches delivered a difficult task. The toast of
                        "Ireland" was received with immense enthusiasm, and, speech- es over, music
                        of a thoroughly national character followed. Among the many excellent songs,
                        a topical version of “Peace, Peace," by Major Donegan, made a great hit,
                        while Mr. Adams proved in excellent voice, and the party did not break up
                        till long after midnight. The thanks of all present are due to the band of
                        the 2nd Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, whose programme included a large
                        number of national and patriotic airs which were admirably ren- dered.</p>

                    <p>Cette dernière quinzaine a été entravée par les fêtes de Pâques et peut-être
                        faut-il s’en féliciter, car bien des positions déjà embaras- sées n’auraient
                        pas manqué do se surcharger encore si la salutaire inaction des vacances
                        n’était venue à point paralyser les transactions. Malgré cet arrêt opportun
                        des affaires, les liquidations de fin du mois ont été excessive- ment
                        laborieuses, pour ne pas dire désastreu- ses. Certains agents laissent
                        vraiment trop de latitude à leurs remisiers et se contentent de marges par
                        trop insuffisantes, de telle sorte qu’à l’échéance leurs clients n’ayant pas
                        les moyens de prendre livraison des titres qu’ils ont achetés se voient
                        contraints de liquider à n’im- porte quel prix. Les ventes qui en résultent
                        mettent évidemment les acheteurs en éveil et ceux-ci toujours à l’affût des
                        bonnes occasions aident à casser les cours pour acheter ensuite à meilleur
                        compte.</p>
                    <p>Le retard apporté au règlement des nou- velles émissions pèse lourdement sur
                        le marché et constitue une des principales causes de la faiblesse actuelle.
                        On a pu voir, en effet, que les positions fin de mois en actions de premier
                        ordre étaient normales, ce qui a maintenu pour ces valeurs une fermeté
                        relative. Ce sont les titres nouvellement émis qui ayant exercé sur là
                        spéculation une fascination malsaine l’ont entrainée hors de toute limite.
                        De petits capitalistes, comptant que les titres en question ne pourraient
                        être livrés que dans un laps de temps considérable, se sont imprudemment
                        engagés et, l’événement ayant devancé leurs prévisions, ont dû liquider avec
                        des pertes énormes. Cette - rapidité dans l’arrivée des titres de
                        l’Investment dont il convient de féli- citer ici les promoteurs et l'Anglo
                        Egyptian Bank a donc été pour les imprévoyants une désagréable surprise.</p>
                    <p>Maintenant le gros de l’orage est passé; réalisations et liquidations
                        pourront bien con- tinuer encore quelques jours, mais les positions se
                        trouvant allégées, les cours ne tarderont pas à reprendre. Espérons, pour
                        que de pareilles liquidations ne se roproduisent pas, qu'on se modèrera
                        désormais en affaires à terme et que les titres en suspens, tels que les
                        Estates, les Trust et les General Trust seront bientôt réglés. Jusque-là un
                        nuage ne cessera de planer sur notre place qui ne pourra vraiment reprendre
                        son essor qu'une fois dégagée de toutes ces en- traves. Il faut s'attendre,
                        sans doute, à un nouveau recul à l’arrivée des titres; beaucoup
                        d'imprévoyants se trouveront sacrifiés; mais il n’y a pas d’autres moyens
                        d’assainir la place.</p>
                    <p>Comme si tous ces désagréments ne suffi- saient pas, nombre d’agences de
                        deuxième ordre se font tirer l'oreille pour le rdglement de leurs affaires
                        et ce sont les agences vrai- ment sérieuses qui doivent en supporter les
                        con- séquences. Aussi beaucoup de maisons de cour- tage réclament-elles
                        instamment un "Clearing House” sur le modèle de celui qui déjà fono- tionne
                        au Caire. On objecte, il est vrai, que les courtiers du Caire ont tous un
                        capital déclaré, tandis que plus d’un tiers de ceux d'Alex- andrie n’ayant
                        pas ou presque pas de capital, auraient des difficultés incessantes avec le
                        Clearing House; mais cette objection même milite en faveur de l’adoption du

                        nouveau comité de l’As- sociation des courtiers en valeurs l’a si bien
                        compris qu’il prépare un règlement pour mettre los choses au point.</p>
                    <p>Les valeurs qui ont donné lieu aux plus forts mouvements pendant cette
                        quinzaine sont l’Agricole, la Daïra, la Salt &amp; Soda et l’Invest-
                        ment.</p>
                    <p>En Agricole les transactions sont toujours importantes. On ouvre à 13 3/8 et
                        touche 13 5/8 pour finir à 13 1/2.</p>
                    <p>En Daïra le cours monte de 27 15/16 à 29 9/16, mais de fortes réalisations
                        ramènent la valeur à 28 13/16. De son côté la Part de Fondateur monte de 164
                        £ à 180 pour re- tomber en clôture à 174.</p>
                    <p>On a échangé journellement des milliers de Salt &amp; Soda. De nombreuses
                        positions sur- chargées liquident et las capitalistes profitent de la baisse
                        qui en résulte pour garnir leurs portefeuilles. On débute à 39, fléchit à
                        34/6 et clôture à 35. On a beaucoup parlé d’un cou- pon médiocre et du
                        prochain établissement en Egypte, à Zagarig et à Mansourah, d’une so- ciété
                        anglaise d’Huileries et Savonneries, mais aucune de ces nouvelles n’est
                        encore con- firmée.</p>
                    <p>De 2 3/16 l’Investment fléchit graduellement jusqu’à 1 13/16 pour reprendre
                        en clôture à 1 31/32 scheteurs. On a échangé durant toute la quinzaine
                        d’énormes paquets de titres. Les deux procès, intentés contre The Egyptian
                        Investment et Agency Limited en palement de dommages intérêts, par des
                        personnes mé- contentes de la répartition des actions émises par la dite
                        société ce non favorisées par elle, ont été jugés mardi par la Chambre
                        Commerciale du Tribunal. La société avait soulevé une ex- ception
                        d’irrecevabilité de l’instance introduite par les dites personnes, ayant
                        déclaré que cette instance devait être dirigée personnelle- ment contre les
                        directeurs à Londres auxquels les souscripteurs s’étaient adressés et qui
                        ont procédé à la répartition. Elle a en outre conclu au fond an rejet de la
                        demande. Le Tribunal a déclaré recevable l’instance dont a’agit, ayant
                        estimé que les actes des directeurs on adminis- trateurs ont engagé la
                        Société, puisqu’ils ont été faits dans son intérêt; mais il a rejeté la
                        demande au fond, ayant déclaré que la dite Société est régie par les lois
                        anglaises; que ces lois et notamment la dernière dénommée "The Companies Act
                        1900" n’ont pas été violées, puisqu’elles accordent aux directeurs et ad-
                        ministrateurs une liberté complète dans l’at- tribution des actions; que la
                        Société a agi dans la plénitude de ses droits en faisant la répartition des
                        actions comme elle l’a entendu et que les termes du prospectus et de la de-
                        mande adressée par les souscripteurs réservent effectivement, pourqui est au
                        courant des moeurs anglaises, aux directeurs de cette Société une liberté
                        complète dans l’attribution des actions.</p>
