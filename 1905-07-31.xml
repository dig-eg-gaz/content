                        <p>Admiral Togo’s offiCial report of the Battle of the Sea of Japan, which
                            appeared in the “Times” of the 24th inst., is the first clear
                            description of the greatest modern sea battle. It contradicts some of
                            the versions of the tactics employed in the fight to which naval experts
                            have given currency in our magazines, and enables the reader to form a
                            juster conclusion than has hitherto been possible of the relative
                            importance of the gun and torpedo and of the value of the tactical
                            formations employed. In the opening paragraphs of the report Admiral
                            Togo points out that in spite of the fog the activity of the Japanese
                            scouts and their free use of wireless telegraphy made “all the condi-
                            tions of the enemy as dear to us who were 30 or 40 miles distant as
                            though they had been under our very eyes. Long before we came in sight
                            of him we knew that his fighting force comprised the Second and Third
                            Squa- drons, that he had 7 special service ships with him, that he was
                            marshalled in two columns line ahead, that his special service vessels
                            followed in the rear, that his speed was about 12 knots, and that he was
                            still advancing to the North Bast.” The ver- sions of correspondents who
                            stated that the Baltic Fleet was formed in three parallel columns, one
                            of cruisers, one of steamships, and one of ironclads, do not seem to be
                            justified by the facts. The right column consisted of the four ships of
                            the Borodino class, the left</p>
                        <cb n="6"/>
                        <p>was led by the Osliabys, followed by Folker sam’s remaining ironclads and
                            Niebogatoff’s squadron. Between the columns were the Jem tchug and
                            Izumrud, acting as scouts, the cruisers under Enquist formed another
                            squad ron in the rear, and a long way south were the steamships, with
                            the Donskoi and Monomach to guard them, in a long column in line
                            ahead.</p>
                        <p>At 2.5 p.m., after the famous signal had been hoisted, Togo’s battleship
                            division steamed diagonally from N.W. to 8.E. on the heads of the
                            Russian columns, the Kamimura—armour ed cruiser—division continuing
                            Togo’s line— i.e., fighting in the line with the battleships. At 6,000
                            yards the Japanese opened fire, con- centrating on the leaders.
                            Rodjestvensky bore away S E. and his two oolumns now formed an irregular
                            line ahead and moved parallel with the enemy. The Osliabya quiokly left
                            the line, Kamimura and Togo closed rapidly, and the Kniaz Suvoroff and
                            the Alexander III. followed the Osliabya, while on the Japanese side the
                            Asama, having her steering gear wrecked and three heavy shells between
                            wind and water, had also to steam away to repair. By 3 p.m. the Japanese
                            were ahead of the Russian line, still moving S.E, and at this point the
                            Russian Admiral suddenly headed N. and attempted to break past the
                            Japanese rear. But Togo and Kamimura’s squadrons wheeled to port and
                            steamed N. W., the armoured oruiser Nishin, which had hitherto been the
                            rear ship of Togo’s division, now lead- ing. Again the Russians were
                            headed off and once more were driven to the E. The Osliabya sank, other
                            vessels were disabled, and the cruiser Jemtchug, which endeavoured to a
                            diversion, was punished for her temerity. At 3.40 p.m. and at 4.45 p.m.
                            torpedo-boat des- troyers and the scout Chihaya made attacks on the
                            damaged Suvoroff. The first attack failed, at the second a torpedo got
                            home, and the ironclad listed to port. At 4.40 the Russian ships turned
                            southward and were lost to sight in the smoke and fog. They seem to have
                            lost their way — four, including one or two coast defence ships, running
                            into the Japanese cruiser divisions that were engaged with Enquist,
                            while the rest turn- ed north again. Togo lost them for a time, and
                            realising the danger to his cruisers, detached Kamimura to aid them in
                            the south, and then went back on his tracks with his own division.
                            Shortly before 6 p.m. be came up on the luck- less Ural (ex Kaiserin
                            Maria-Teresa of the N.D.L.): “the squadron fired once into her and sank
                            her.” At 6 p.m. he was once more in touch with six Russian ironclads
                            steaming N.W. and keeping up with them he hammered them till nightfall.
                            The Alexander III. and Borodino left the line and sank, apparently from
                            gunfire, for Togo does not mention the use of torpe- does, though the
                            Borodino may have been struck while sinking, as survivors asserted.</p>
                        <p>Meantime the protected cruisers had fought. Dewa and Uriu, shortly after
                            2 p.m., raked the rear of Enquist’s cruiser division and coming up on
                            his starboard (E.) side fought him on a parallel course or, using their
                            speed, smashed the head of his column. The S.S. ships in the rear fall
                            into disorder though they do not seem to have been the object of any
                            special attack, and attempts made by the Aurora and by three destroyers
                            to close- were repulsed. After 4 p.m. two special-ser- vice vessels, the
                            Irtish and Anastasni, were sunk and the divisions of Kataoka and Togo
                            Masamichi, including the Chinyen and the older cruisers, came into
                            action. At this point four Russian ironclads came back from the N. E.,
                            and in the struggle that followed Dewa's flagship, the Kasagi, was
                            disabled and Dewa transferred his flag to the Chitose, with which he
                            convoyed her to Aburaya Bay handing over his two other cruisers to Uriu.
                            Uriu’s flagship, the Naniwa, was next disabled by a shell under the
                            water-line and had to leave the fight at 6.10 p.m. for some hours. But
                            at 6.30 p.m. Kamimura arrived and reliev- ed the pressure and the
                            Russians lied north. Togo, Masamiohi, and Kotaoka des- troyed the
                            Kamtchatka and after 7 p.m. engaged the helpless Suvaroff. With one gun
                            left serviceable she fought the Fujimoto torpedo section, which fell on
                            her covered by the cruisers, but two hits sent her to the bottom.
                            Shortly afterwards Togo’s orders arrived to rendez vous at Urleung
                            Island. The Japanese ran N. E. and Enquist, to judge from the Russian
                            account of the battle, ran south-west with three cruisers, and did not
                            stop till he reached Manila. Here is the situation at nightfall on the
                            27th May. Two Russian battleship divisions are moving N., one iso- lated
                            and watched by the destroyer flotillas attached to Togo’s force, one
                            accompanied by sundry S.S. ships and cruisers some distance to the south
                            and in great disorder, which steadily increases. The Japanese battle
                            squa- dron is between the Russians and Vladivostok, and making for
                            Urleung. Kamimura is on his way to join it, Togo Masamichi, Uriu with
                            two of Dewa’s ships and apparently Kotaoka are moving N. parallel with
                            the Russian rear, and the torpedo flotillas are closing in on the enemy.
                            All is prepared for the final and utter destruction of the remnants of a
                            great fleet, for the driving home of the lesson that in war, if machines
                            count for much, men count for more.</p>

                            bottom. The Turkish police, on being asked to explain their conduct,
                            could only say that the sheikh was known to be a friend of the late
                            Grand Mufti of Egypt! We should have thought that such a recom-
                            mendation should have saved him from mole- station, but they order
                            matters otherwise in the Ottoman dominions.</p>
                        <p>The Plague.—Saturday’s bulletin records four fresh oases (one fatal) and

                            Sudanese servant of a house in Rosetta- street, (3) a native street
                            sweeper of Eyouni. The fatal case was that of another sweeper who was
                            found dead at the Ragheb Pasha esheshes. A case was also reported from
                            Port Said. Yesterday’s bulletin records two fatal cases at Alexandria,
                            the victims being a native carter and a native coffee-house keeper.</p>
                        <p>Corporation of Western Egypt, Ltd.—The directors have placed orders for
                            farther steam drillers, which will be shipped to Egypt at the earliest
                            possibly date. These steam drillers will be located at' the
                            Corporation’s depot at Farshut on the Nile as a reserve against any
                            possible breakdown on the part of those at present in the Khargeh Oasis.
                            It is the intention of the board to work these latter in double shifts
                            with an extra staff of men so as to obtain maximum results. Spare parts
                            in connection with all drillers are also being provided, in order that
                            the success of the well-boring operations, shortly to bp resumed on a
                            much larger scale, may be completely assured.</p>

                        <p>We have received a copy of the proceedings of the general meeting of the
                            Fajyoum Light Railway Company, held at the company's Cairo office on
                            Jane 9 last, Khalid Bey Lontfi being in the chair.</p>
                        <p>The report of the administrative board was read to the shareholders
                            present. It stated that in spite of several requests by letter the
                            Ministry of Public Works had not yet given its consent to the
                            construction of a line from Bioufi toKiman Far6s. L E.
                            1,123.646mm.,being the balance left in hand after the payment of oonpons
                            No. 1 and No. 2, had been carried over to the accounts of the ourrent
                            year. The Mixed Court of Appeal had agreed to the demand of the company
                            that expert examina- tion of the various bureaux of the company should
                            be made, but the experts had ceased to Visit the bureaux though their
                            task was still incomplete. The provisional modifications in the
                            passenger tariff had proved so satisfactory both to the public and to
                            the company, that it had been decided to confirm them. The arrangements
                            made for the transport of goods from all the company’s stations to those
                            of the State Railway Administration and vice versa had proved beneficial
                            to the public, if they had not been of great advantage to the company,
                            which had agreed to the demand of the Railway Administration that It
                            should forward goods from its stations to Port Said and El Kantara.
                            During the year dating from March 1, 1904, to February 28, 1905, the
                            general situation of the company was as follows. The condition of the
                            lines and the traffic were satisfactory. An able European engineer had
                            been engaged who had organised the repairing work in the ateliers, and
                            altered and improved the time-table. It had been decided to dispense
                            with the services of Rangabe Bey, ex-director of the company, who would
                            be temporarily replaced by Mo- hamed Effendi Gazim. The company’s
                            receipts showed an increase of L.E. 4,091.166m.m. on the figures of the
                            previous year, while the expenses had only increased by L.E.882.876mm.
                            This rise was entirely due to the increased traffic on the company’s
                            lines. The total profits for the year, after making every deduc- tion,
                            amounted to L.E. 8,546.676m.m. Per- mission was demanded to pay the sum
                            of L.E. 8,143.200mm., the total of the two cou- pons, viz., 5,220 bonds

                            the 720 bonds of the 2nd issue, the payment to be made as follows : —
                            Coupons No. 3 of the first issue and coupons No. 2 of the second issue,
                            falling due on December 31, 1902, to be paid on July 9, 1905 ; cou- pons
                            No. 4 of the first and coupons No. 3 of the second issue, all of which
                            fall due on December 31, 1903, to be paid off on August 9, 1905, the
                            remainder of the profits to be carried over to the accounts of the
                            current year. This was unanimously agreed to after the balance-sheet,
                            profit and loss ac- count, and auditors’ report had been presented to
                            the general meeting. The report of the acountants was also passed and it
                            was de- cided that the board should appoint acount ants for next year,

                            to fill the post. Certain land owners having presented proposals for the
                            extension of the Kalamsha line to Abou Hamad, it was deoided to snbmit
                            these pro- posals to the board and empower it, if it con- sidered these
                            proposals advantageous, to re- port on them and call an extraordinary

                        <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
                        <p>- Port Said, Monday. The Russian auxiliary cruiser Kuban, one of the
                            vessels which the Russian Admiralty purchased from the Hamburg-Amerika
                            Line, arrived last evening from, the Canal and has lain here all night.
                            She is to sail this evening for Libau. The vessel, which has a crew of
                            500 men and steams 22 knots, displaces 8,490 tons. She was with the
                            squadron at the Battle of Tsushima and remained some few hours within
                            signalling distance of Rodjestvensky’s battle- ships, using her five 4-7
                            guns. When the torpedo destroyer flotilla was let loose on what remained
                            of the Russian vessels, the Kuban retreated at full speed and eventually
                            escaped without injury. The Kuban lay in Saigon for the usual period and
                            then proceeded. I understand the case of the Fazilka is the only one of
                            the kind that , has occurred since the Kuban started on her homeward
                            voyage. She does not coal here, though permission to do so has been
                            granted, and has only taken a limited quantity of provisions and
                            water.</p>

                        <p>I hear on excellent authority that Messrs. Dowrie And Co., who are the
                            lessees of the point bearing their name, have been paid an indem- nity
                            for loss of frs. 600,000 by the Canal Com- pany. The piece of land on
                            which their works stood originally belonged to the British Ad- miralty,
                            and the Canal Company, in the harbour widening which is now going on,
                            decided to remove the point to the extent of some 35 metres. To this end
                            they communicated with the Admiralty and I believe a large piece of land
                            behind Navy House has been given them in exchange, thus putting the
                            Canal Company in the position of landlords to Dowrie And Co., —result,
                            this heavy indemnity.</p>

                        <p>The steamer Newton Hall, having been ordered to tie up close to Kilo. 133
                            in the Canal, sent tier lines ashore in the usual way. Some form of
                            discussion appears to have taken place with some Arabs who are working
                            on the Canal bank repairs, which terminated in the latter throwing the
                            mooring boatmen into the Canal. The immediate result was that the vessel
                            was unable to tie up, fell across the stream, and went ashore. The
                            ship’s boat was lowered and an officer and boat’s crew from the ship
                            sent to carry the lines to the proper post, but they appear to have
                            received the same treatment. Daring these attempts the vessel managed to
                            get one of her hawsers round her propeller, thus putting a climax to her
                            chapter of misfortunes. She is at present in- capable of movement, but
                            divers will be sent to her to-day and hopes are expressed that she may
                            be able to proceed shortly. The Canal Company are holding an enquiry
                            into the scatter, which is of the utmost gravity, and may, if it occur
                            again, cause a blocking of the traffic. It is by no means the first case
                            of its kind.</p>

                        <p>(From a Correspondent.)</p>
                        <p>On Thursday last, a most successful small dance was held at Suez on board
                            the E.T.C. cable ship Electra by the captain and officers. The ship’s
                            quarter-deck was the temporary ball room and a most excellent one it
                            made, tastefully decorated with flags of all descrip- tions, the awnings
                            overhead being roofed in with the ensigns of all nations, while electric
                            lights in Chinese lanterns shed a soft and romantic light on the
                            brilliant and cheerful assembly, chief of whom was H. E. the Governor,
                            who was-apparently in the best of spirits and greatly pleased with
                            everything. The deck made an excellent floor and the music was of the
                            best, the hosts being fortunate in preparing the services of Mile
                            Gladulich, who played the piano to perfection, thus greatly adding to
                            the success of the evening. The piano was placed in quite a little
                            bower, viz., on a raised plat- form at the stern draped round with flags
                            and decorated with plants.</p>
                        <p>The night was perfect for the occasion and Captain Sparks and his
                            officers missed but very few of their friends, who included practically
                            all the English-speaking community of Suez. 2 am. saw the end of one of
                            the most successful small dances ever held on board ship in Suez, the
                            hosts being amply repaid for their trouble and the care taken over the
                            decora- tions,by the enthusiastic admiration expressed on all hands.</p>

                        <p>The past week’s stock markets, although distinctly better in tone, offer
                            little opportunity to your correspondent to write much of inter- est.
                            There continues to be a good demand for investment stocks, and there is
                            certainly a growing feeling of confidence in the hope of a good result
                            of the peace conference, especially as the general opinion is thai this
                            has by no means been discounted here.</p>
                        <p>The mining section cannot be said to be "out of the wood,’’ for mining
                            securities are being looked at more and more askance by the banks and
                            loans to mining firms are by no means easy to negotiate. This adversely
                            affects the Egypt- ian Mining section,—a treatment it does not deserve.
                            An excellent export of United Afri- cans has followed the good export of
                            the Nile Valley Company. Although the market has certainly improved, it
                            has not responded so readily as it would have done under better general
                            conditions.</p>
                        <p>Other Egyptian securities are steady, with little doing. Land shares are
                            practically un- changed, and Banks firms, the strongest point being
                            Agricultural Banks at 14, for ransom to which we drew attention last
                            week.</p>
                        <p>Gilt-edged stocks are quite neglected and Consols have declined 1/8 to 90
                            1/16 for money and 90 1/8 for the account. The new Japanese loan is
                            offered at 1 premium for the special settlement, the previous issue
                            being quoted at 93. Russians are inclined to be easier.</p>
