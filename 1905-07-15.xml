                    <head>CYPRUS AS A PLACE OF ARMS.</head>
                    <p>“Turkish troops reoccupied the island three weeks later and the Cyprus
                        place-of-arms bubble finally burst”—such was a forecast made a few years
                        back by a writer of no little ability who had set himself to describe the
                        course of the next naval war in which Great Britain might be engaged.
                        Pessimistic enough the forecast was, but it would have been accepted by many
                        students of Near Eastern politics at the time. In those days France was the
                        probable enemy, Russia was a naval Power, and a struggle between Great
                        Britain and the Dual Alliance was anticipated by half our publicists. But
                        the coming of the “entente cordiale” alters the Mediterranean situation most
                        profoundly, and, with Great Britain’s dominant position in Egypt recognised,
                        Cyprus may become at last a useful asset to the Empire. At the time when
                        Disraeli’s diplomacy won the island, it was hoped or feared, as men were
                        Turcophile or Turcophobe, that the break-up of the Ottoman Empire was at
                        hand and that the Power that happened to be in occupation of Cyprus would be
                        in a position to safeguard its own interests in Syria and Asia Minor with
                        the minimum of difficulty. But Cyprus proved less useful a possession than
                        had been expected. It was too far from the theatre of possible hostilities
                        to be likely to serve as a useful naval base. The harbour of Famagusta did
                        indeed promise great things, but only after the expenditure of millions ;
                        and the garrison that first occupied the island in 1878 was rapidly reduced.
                        As a “place of arms” Cyprus seemed to have proved useless.</p>
                    <p>But time has changed Mediterranean politics, and Great Britain’s interest is
                        once more directed to the East. There is no fear of France assailing Malta
                        from her bases at Bizerta or Algiers ; Gibraltar fears no hostile occupation
                        of Tangier, but Cyprus may give the chief naval power of the world a useful
                        naval and military base within striking distance of countries whose
                        occupation by certain Powers or whose devastation by civil strife, could not
                        but cause grave menace to her interests. Yet eight battalions of British
                        regulars are at present quartered in Malta, a most unhealthy station, where
                        no troops can manœuvre or get any useful field training, where Mediterranean
                        fever is endemic, and where the heat and the monotony of life in a small and
                        over-crowded island greatly react on the spirits of the garrison.</p>
                    <p>Cyprus, whether as a sanatorium or as a station for, say, a brigade, offers
                        great advantages. In the first place, the coast is not unhealthy in winter
                        and the malarial fever that visits certain towns in summer can be avoided by
                        transferring their garrisons to the cool and healthy range of the Troodos.
                        In the second place, troops stationed in the island will have ample
                        facilities for manoeuvring which are totally lacking in Malta, where the
                        whole island is so thickly inhabited that a squad can hardly leave a road
                        without damaging somebody’s vines or vegetables. Finally, the increase of
                        German influence in the Near East, the signs of unrest which have appeared
                        among the Arab subjects of the Ottoman Empire, and the fact that in Beyrout,
                        where British commercial interests are largely represented, religious strife
                        and mob violence may flare up again at any moment, should a weak Governor
                        unhappily replace the present Vali, make it necessary for British statesmen
                        to remember that even a couple of battalions within seven hours of the
                        Syrian Coast may one day be of far greater use than a large force locked up
                        in unthreatened Malta.</p>

                            at Longchamps on the occasion of the 14th of July. Sir L. Bertie,
                            British Ambassador, presented Admiral May to President Loubet. The
                            British officers at Brest likewise attended a review of marines and
                            seamen. There was much international enthusiasm.</p>

                        <p>Chamber of Deputies.—The Nationalist M. Lasies denounced the inclusion in
                            the amnesty of the “low reptiles” that General André employed to spy
                            upon their comrades. This caused an uproar, and M. Berteaux, Minister of
                            War, in a very excited condition after such an insult, refused any
                            longer to support a Bill which mainly benefits the Nationalists. The
                            sitting was suspended on account of the tumult. On the resumption M.
                            Rouvier read a decree closing the session, and the Bill is thus wrecked.
                            The Cabinet subsequently recommended President Loubet to pardon all whom
                            the Bill would have benefited, but M. Deroulède and others will probably
                            not accept this.</p>

                    <head>THE 14th OF JULY. CELEBRATION IN CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>The festivities held annually by the French colony of Cairo, in celebration
                        of the great events of the 14th of July have once more been a thorough
                        success.</p>
                    <p>A reception of the chief members of the French colony took place at the
                        French Consulate at 10 a.m. and M. Bousquet received his guests with his
                        usual warmth.</p>
                    <p>Many of the larger buildings in the princi- pal streets of Cairo were
                        decorated with tricolour flags, and Sharia Kamel in particular presented a
                        very gay appearance. Many of the French establishments were illuminated
                        after sunset, and the Esbekieh Gardens, which were the scene of the
                        principal festivities, were most effectively decorated; and the numerous
                        Chinese lanterns, gas jets, and coloured electric globes, which had been
                        arranged in most artistic designs, gave a most picturesque and fairy-like
                        look to the gardens.</p>
                    <p>The gates opened at 9 p.m. and large crowds at once streamed in. M. Bonsquet
                        was greeted on his arrival by the strains of the “Marseillaise,” played by
                        the two military bands and a string band which were in attendance. The
                        French anthem was repeated on the arrival of M. Bonin, who is replacing M.
                        de la Boulinière in Cairo, and arrived at 9.30 p.m., followed by Mr. F. W.
                        Machell, who had been deputed to represent H.B.M.’s Agency, and was greeted
                        by the British national anthem.</p>
                    <p>The principal attractions of the evening were supplied by the bands of the
                        Inniskilling Fusiliers and the Egyptian Cavalry, who played alternately, by
                        the variety entertainment of the fall troupe of the Nouveautés music hall,
                        and by a pyrotechnic display. The fireworks were unfortunately somewhat
                        affected by the damp, and the set-pieces were to a great extent hid by
                        clouds of smoke. The rockets, Roman candles, etc., were far more successful.
                        The fireworks over, many of those present began to dance and continued
                        dancing to their heart’s content till after 2 a.m.</p>
                    <p>We hope to give further details of the festivities in our Monday’s issue.</p>

                        <dateline>Port Said, Friday.</dateline>
                        <p>Yesterday, the sunken dredger Pharaon II. was, by the aid of the Canal
                            Company’s shear legs, turned over on to the cradle which had been
                            prepared for its reception and sunk to the bottom of the harbour. I
                            learn from one of the engineers who are at work on her salvage, that the
                            original idea has been dropped and that she will be raised by means of
                            iron lighters, which have been bolted together on pairs and will be
                            sunk, attached to the cradle, and then pumped out. Their lifting power
                            is theoretically 1,200 tons.</p>

                        <p>In commemoration of the French national fête there has been arranged for
                            this evening an illuminated Venetian procession, to consist of upwards
                            of 200 boats of all sizes. There will also be an orchestral concert,
                            which is to be followed by a firework display. The town is one mass of
                            flags and Chinese lanterns, and as in former years, crowds of people
                            fill the main streets and cafes.</p>

                        <p>Reliable information regarding railway improvements here, in view of the
                            neat alterations which the Matarieh Canal and port changes will bring
                            about, is most difficult to obtain, but levelling and road-making
                            operations are to be seen both on Dowrie point and behind the railway
                            station. The end of this point is to be cut away to make the harbour
                            wider, and on the remaining land warehouses are to be constructed. The
                            back of the railway station land abuts on that portion of the lake at
                            which the town terminus of the Matarieh Canal will be cut; this is all
                            being levelled and marked out in lots ready for occupation in the near
                            future.</p>

                            The Mosque Abbas has been over two years in construction and was very
                            beautifully decorated for the occasion. The ceremony was conducted by

                            and of Abdul Hakim Pasha, who had come from Cairo expressly. This latter

                    <head>THE SPECIALISING OF ROLLING STOCK IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The growing tendency in Egypt is to order specially designed rolling-stook to
                        suit the requirements of the goods to be carried, and to discard the
                        heterogeneous and out-of-date collection of wagons which had found their way
                        into the country from all sorts of sources. British makers have cause to be
                        thankful for this, as the bulk of the orders are now being placed in their
                        hands. This policy is not merely confined to the Government lines, but
                        private companies are following suit.</p>
                    <p>A case in point, and one which serves to show also how great and growing an
                        industry is scientific farming in the land of the Pharaohs, is afforded by
                        the eight special bogie wagons ordered from the Leeds Forge Co. by the
                        Société des Sucreries et de la Raffinerie d’Egypte for one of their private
                        lines. These wagons have been designed wholly and solely for the purpose of
                        transporting steam ploughing engines and their tackle from one district to
                        another to enable them to enlarge their field of operations.</p>
                    <p>Each wagon is provided at one end with a ramp, hinged to the headstock of the
                        underframe, which can be lowered on to the rails, and a hand-winch at the
                        other end, to enable the ploughing engine to be hauled on to the wagon or
                        removed therefrom. When the wagons are running the ramp is lifted to a
                        vertical position, and there secured by stays. The buffers on the ramp end
                        of the underframe are hinged at the bottom, so that by taking a cotter out
                        of the top they will drop out of the way of the ramp. Struts are also placed
                        under this end of the wagon, which require to be adjusted slightly above the
                        rail level to take a portion of the weight while the engine is over the
                        same, thus preventing the underframe being strained through the whole of the
                        load being carried by one bogie. It is not necessary, however, to use these
                        struts when the plough or cultivator is being placed on the wagon, as these
                        machines are, of course, considerably lighter than the engine. The struts
                        can be placed out of the way on a hook under the headstock when the wagon is
                        running. The ramp is raised and lowered by passing the rope from the winch
                        through a snatch-block, which is attached to the underframe and then over
                        struts on the ramp. The struts can be lowered to the level of the floor out
                        of the way when the engine is being hauled up the ramp.</p>
                    <p>When power is required for lifting the engine, the same snatch-block is used.
                        The rope is attached to the engine, passed through the block and back to a
                        hook under the winch. The winch is designed to give a pull of three tons
                        from the barrel when working in double purchase—i. e., a total pull of six
                        tons is available when using the snatoh-blook on the engine for hauling the
                        latter on to the wagon. The weight of the ploughing engine is twenty- two
                        tons.</p>

                    <p>"I care not what has been said of Mohamed Abdou by those who gather together
                        and exult over his death.</p>
                    <p>"But our Faith I have endeavoured to reform.</p>
                    <p>“Fearing its ruin by those who wear turbans.</p>
                    <p>“Every living being has hopes that he longs to accomplish.</p>
                    <p>“If I die all my hopes will come to naught</p>
                    <p>"O God, if Thou wilt, heal me or take me to the other world.</p>
                    <p>“Bless the world of Islam and grant it good guidance, an enlightened guide,
                        the path of righteousness in the darkness of night”</p>
                    <p>(“Al Mokattam.”)</p>
                    <p>Our relations with the Grand Mufti, Shaikh Mohamed Abdou, were intimate and
                        friendly before the rising led by Arabi Pasha, and our friendship was
                        renewed during the residence of the exiled Sheikh in Syria. Our friendship
                        was no mere matter of intimacy, but was based upon the harmony of our
                        principles on all matters connected with the Welfare of Egypt We both
                        realised the inconvenience arising from the attitude of those who opposed
                        progress with no arguments but those of ignoranoe.......Egypt has sustained
                        a loss which will be hard to remedy, a loss whose results God only can know.
                        The most enlightened and advanced man in Egypt, his teaching was a light to
                        the minds of the students and Ulema and to all who longed for something
                        beyond the old theories, which did not satisfy the needs of the modern
                        social system....Again, the deceased was most anxious to see the results of
                        his work, and was a really great reformer and seeker after Egypt’s welfare.
                        As a teacher and expounder of religious theory to the students of Al Azhar,
                        as an enlightened author, as manager of ancient schools and administrator of
                        numerous benevolent societies, he was known to all. His reforming influence
                        was made manifest in the Legislative Council, while he was ever ready to
                        defend his faith against insult. He was constantly employed on charitable
                        committees formed to assist the victims of fire or other misfortunes. He
                        always endeavoured to prevent any cause of hostility between Egyptians and
                        foreigners.........and before the era of legality he did not fear the
                        despotism of the Government, but his defence of liberty of action and
                        thought brought him trouble throughout his life.</p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Dear Editor,—The death of the Grand Mufti, Sheikh Mohamed Abdou, is a
                            great loss not only to Egypt but to every Mohamedan country. It was the
                            privilege of the writer to spend some days with him before he went to
                            Alexandria, and to love him as a son loves his father. In this age of
                            the world civilisation, although still very faulty, teaches us religious
                            toleration. The Moslems need to learn this lesson as well as the
                            Christians. It is very difficult, but we know the grand old Sheikh had
                            learned it well and was not afraid to teach it against most fanatic
                            opposition. It is a most worthy object, especially for us young men, to
                            ever keep alive the memory of this gentle, loving, wise man, who was
                            forced to lay down his work before he wished—and who was so active in
                            his love for God and Egypt to the very last. Let us study his life and
                            be influenced by it</p>

                        <head>THE RAMLEH RAILWAY.</head>
                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir,—Might I trespass upon your valuable space to draw attention to a
                            most serious matter affecting the public, or at least that portion of it
                            who live at Ramleh,—I refer to the running of the tram cars on the
                            Alexandria and Ramleh railroad. Surely some system may be devised to
                            prevent the overcrowding of the San Stefano cars. Could it not be
                            arranged that they stop only at the small stations, i.e., Carlton,
                            Sporting Club, etc., and pass the larger stations; as it seems to me the
                            latter are very efficiently attended to by the Palais cars. It is no
                            uncommon sight to see the San Stefano cars absolutely filled, and people
                            hanging to the outside, while a Palais car comes along with plenty of
                            room. Doubtless this is well known to the officials of the line, but for
                            some inscrutable reason it is allowed to go on. After all, it is only in
                            keeping with the terminus at Alexandria, where passengers have to stand
                            in the sun and dust, in the dustiest corner of the city, while waiting
                            for a car ; and this has to be borne from a company that, I am informed,
                            pays a dividend of 20 % - I am, etc.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN LAND AND GENERAL TRUST. SUCCESSFUL ESTABLISHMENT OF THE
                        COMPANY</head>
                    <p>The statutory meeting of the Egyptian Land and General Trust Company,
                        Limited, was held in London on the 6th inst, at Winchester House, Old Broad
                        Street, Sir Willing F. Haynes Smith, K.C.M.G., LL.D. (chairman of the
                        company), presiding.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary having read the notice convening the meeting,</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said : Gentlemen, as you are aware, this is the formal statutory
                        meeting of our company, at which I have to inform you that the requirements
                        of the Companies Act have been complied with, and that we are now in a
                        position to deal with the business brought before us. The company was
                        incorporated on March 27th, 1905, and the necessary certificate to commence
                        business was obtained on April 11th, 1905. The capital offered for
                        subscription was £200,000, in £1 shares. These were very largely over
                        applied for. To give the exact figures, applications were received for
                        941,438 shares, of which 584,160 came from Egypt, and the remaining 357,278
                        were received in London. The company was formed without the assistance of
                        any promoter, and the expenses, which were clearly stated in the prospectus,
                        were paid by the company. With the exception of these expenses, which were
                        exceptionally small, the company started business with its capital intact.
                        Egypt and its affairs are now so well known that I need not allude to the
                        opportunities for remunerative business on a sound basis which can be there
                        obtained. All those interested in the country have learned to wait for, as
                        one of the events of the year, the publication of the annual report of Lord
                        Cromer, showing in detail the continuous records of that marvellous
                        development of the country on all sides, year by year, under the direction
                        of one master mind, which has attracted universal attention. Still, it may
                        be of use to draw attention to a few of the more salient facts—such as the
                        increase of revenue, which last year amounted to L.E. 13,906,152, and was
                        L.E. 2,406,000 in excess of the estimates. Again, the increase of its trade
                        calls for attention, for the imports last year were valued at L.E.
                        19,889,000, or L E. 3,742,000 more than in 1903, while the exports were
                        valued at L.E. 20,316,000 or L.E. 1,200,000 more than in 1903. This is
                        exclusive of the tobacco trade, which alone is of large dimensions. Every
                        year a stream of gold flows into Egypt, supplied by the increasing numbers
                        of people who visit it for amusement or health or business. Large additional
                        areas are brought under irrigation,and the productive land yields its
                        continuous crops to the patient and laborious cultivator, who is thrifty and
                        lives on little, while he is careful of his money. Wealth is thus
                        accumulated, and there appears to be a strong tendency to invest these
                        savings in land, thereby creating a steady market. As illustrating the
                        disposition of many of the Egyptian investors, it is striking to notice the
                        rising prices quoted for leading stocks in Egypt. The investor there does
                        not appear to look so much to present dividends as to the property and
                        reserve funds acquired by the different corporations. Land and its
                        development is naturally one of the investments which first attracts
                        attention, and although various companies have been recently formed with the
                        object similar to our own, yet there seems no reason to doubt that there is
                        an ample field open for the profitable use of our capital if judiciously
                        invested. The company, in dealing with Egyptian affairs, has the advantage
                        of the services of three directors in Egypt, who have your confidence. These
                        directors are His Excellency Crookshank Pasha, the British representative of
                        the Daira Administration; Mr. Lonsdorfer, the well-known merchant ; aud our
                        Agent-General, Mr. Hooker, who is well known in respect of his public
                        services in Egypt, and greatly respected. As out distinguished director
                        Crookshank Pasha is so intimately connected with the Daira Administration,
                        perhaps you will forgive me for shortly drawing your attention to some of
                        the published results. The whole of the debt is to be liquidated in October
                        next. The rent roll has been increased to no less than L.E.1,094,815. or an
                        average of L.E. 6,52 per acre. With respect to the value of the land,
                        Crookshank Pasha writes as follows : —"With the conversion of the basin
                        irrigation in Middle Egypt into perenoial irrigation, and a constant supply
                        of good water assured by the Assouan dam and Assiout barrage, I am confident
                        that we have not yet reached the highest prices that the land is worth.”
                        This is a view which is shared by many other high authorities. To the same
                        effect is a record of the sales of the Domains’ lands last year, when 2,958
                        acres were sold by auction. They were estimated at £26 6s per acre, and
                        realised £64 17s per acre. Dealing with agricultural lands, there appears to
                        be a great opening for our comjany in acquiring land which requires
                        reclamation. In any such case, our company would honestly mean to reclaim
                        land thoroughly within a fixed period, and when this was completely
                        effected, sell it in suitable portions, to the small proprietor. I had some
                        years ago to endeavour to assist a somewhat similar class in analogous
                        conditions, and, speaking generally, I can only say that they rendered an
                        exact fulfilment of their obligations, that there were no bad debts, while
                        the investment was remunerative. An important point in connection with these
                        questions is that under the Land Department of the Government it is easy to
                        obtain a registered title, while the fee on transfer has been reduced from 5
                        per cent. to 2 percent. Dealing with the questions immediately before the
                        directors, they have in hand important business for the acquisition of lands
                        in Cairo. Our agent general, Mr. Hooker, considered it of such moment that
                        he came specially to England to</p>
                    <p><cb/>confer with the board, and your directors, after going into the matter
                        most carefully with him, as a result of their investigation authorised him
                        to at once return to Egypt to carry out the transactions. You will readily
                        understand that it is inexpedient at present to go more closely into details
                        of pending business,but thedirectors consider that the arrangements when
                        completed will be entirely satisfactory to the shareholders. Besides dealing
                        with land in Cairo, the board have now under consideration the question of
                        acquiring and developing lands in Alexandria for building purposes. In this
                        and all other similar cases the object of the board is only to enter on
                        transactions if the prices are such as to offer a good opening for
                        remuneratively employing a portion of its capital. Your directors have other
                        important business under consideration which is not ripe to put before you
                        to-day. I regret that the company are unable to participate in the issue of
                        a company for the development of one of the large mining concessions on the
                        lines intended, but there are various other enterprises connected with the
                        development of land in Egypt which are now being worked out, and the
                        question as to how far these can be advantageously supported by the company
                        will come before the board. It is not merely that the large centres like
                        Cairo and Alexandria are greatly extending, but improvement is manifested in
                        all parts of the couutry. I can testify to the striking object-lesson of the
                        effects of the administration in Egypt, which is having a marvellous effect
                        in various parts of Asia Minor and the Levant, and people are leaving these
                        latter countries and abandoning property for which they have paid large sums
                        in order to open business and carry on their transactions in Egypt. In one
                        of the important towns on the Syrian coast—in Beyrout—this emigration of
                        those engaged in the largest business has produced a marked effect. It has
                        been represented to us that many of the Egyptian investors desire to pay for
                        their shares in full and obtain bearer warrants, and to meet this demand the
                        directors are having them prepared, and they will shortly be issued to those
                        who desire them. In laying before you so far as I can properly do so the
                        action of the board during the very short period since the company has been
                        formed, it is, of course, necessary to be reticent as to pending business,
                        but I think the shareholders may be assured that the prospects open for the
                        employment of the capital of the company are likely to be fully satisfactory
                        to them, and the company has every prospect of entering upon sound business
                        which must develop and increase, and which, with the continued prosperity of
                        Egypt and its growing volume of trade, must yield good results. In the
                        meantime the capital of the company, while employed on investments
                        realisable at short notice, remains available for the enterprises in
                        prospect, and the shareholders have the satisfaction of knowing that the
                        company has been inaugurated and formed and brought to its preseut position
                        at the least possible cost. As His Excellency Crookshank Pasha is here, I am
                        sure you will like to hear a few words from him. (Hear, hear.)</p>
                    <p>His Excellency Crookshank Pasha said that, as the only member of the Egyptian
                        board present in England, he felt it his imperative duty to attend the
                        meeting and emphasise what the chairman had said with regard to Egypt and
                        investments there. He was particularly interested in Egypt and had a great
                        belief in its future. Things marched slowly in the East, but although they
                        had only been in existence a quarter of a year they had already achieved a
                        very considerable success. He was very glad to hear from the chairman that
                        the business they had taken in hand with regard to the purchase of building
                        land in the heart of Cairo was well on way. The difficulty there was that
                        before finally closing the business they have to be quite sure that the
                        title deeds were absolutely correct. When that was done everything would be
                        straight sailing. With regard to Alexandria, that was a large and prosperous
                        oity, and was every day extending all round. They fully expected to
                        establish a very remunerative business, but things did not progress quickly
                        in Egypt. Contrary to the general rule, however, the price of land had gone
                        up in a few years in the most extraordinary way. It was only within the last
                        few years that people had begun to realise what could be made out of land,
                        and this applied to building land as well as to agricultural land. Land
                        which not many years ago could be got at £20 to £30 per acre could not be
                        purchased now under £70 or £90. Again, land which not many years ago was
                        offered them at something under £1 or 15s. a metre could not be purchased
                        now under £10 a metre. The result was that a large number of companies had
                        been started, but they could congratulate themselves on being first in the
                        field, and he had great faith in the future of the company.</p>
                    <p>A vote of thanks to the chairman terminated the proceedings.</p>

                    <head>MANCHESTER SHIP CANAL. NEW DOCK OPENED BY THE KING.</head>
                    <p>King Edward VII. left Lord Derby’s residence at Knowsley on Thursday,
                        accompanied by the Queen, and travelled from there to Manchester, where he
                        opened the new dock which has been added to the Manchester Ship Canal at a
                        cost of £500,000. This new dock, the entrance to which is on the Old
                        Trafford opposite the grain elevator, has been named the King’s Dock. Its
                        length is 2,700 feet, its breadth 250 feet, its depth 28 feet, and it has a
                        water area of 15 acres, so that it is one of the largest docks in the United
                        Kingdom and will accommodate any of our largest vessels. It has been
                        constructed in a series of masonry pier and arches so that when a large
                        vessel enter the "wash" will not be felt by other vessels moored to the
                        quay, as would have been the case were it built of solid masonry. Its steam
                        and electric cranes, subway haulage, quay tracks, sidings, and shed, will
                        enable an unlimited amount of cargo to be dealt with.</p>

                    <head>ON THE HEDJAZ RAILWAY.</head>
                    <byline>BY P. P. G.</byline>
                    <p>IX.</p>
                    <p>When my conversation with the Tcherkess had died through the exhaustion of
                        our vocabularies, M. Nicola reappeared and insisted that I should dine with
                        him at the restaurant. There we repaired and in due time got our allowance
                        of vermicelli soup and poached eggs with mastic and glasses of a strong
                        wine. Some Turks and Italians sat there and cracked jokes with the owner of
                        the tent, a grossly fat personage who now and again sang snatches of songs
                        and then clapped his hands and broke into the howl of the Arab<hi
                            rend="italic">claqueur</hi>. When we left the tent it was bitterly cold
                        (40% Fahrenheit) and I felt myself turning blue, and wondered no more at the
                        sweaters with which the Turks clothed themselves. I was told that water
                        froze on the desert—which is a good 3,000 feet above sea level—till May on
                        cold nights, and that the wind and cold made the winter very trying. Once in
                        bed I got warm enough in no time, the bloodthirsty Circassian giving me a
                        hide of some sort to add to my covers. It had a bad smell but I was too
                        tired to mind, and I slept the sleep of the just till 4 a.m., when I got up
                        and made ready for the morning train. I left at 5 a.m, after quite an
                        agitated scene with M. Nicola, who would not accept a piastre from me and
                        was insulted by the offer, asserting that all Christians in the East should
                        help one another— a most excellent rule, which I followed by leaving a small
                        bottle 2/3rds full of brandy under his desk when he was not looking. I slept
                        in the train till we got to Jurf el Derwish, when some severer jolts than
                        usual aroused me. Some very black Bedouins got in here and promptly took off
                        most of their clothes and slept in their cloaks on the floor.</p>
                    <p>The end of the carriage was screened off for a harem with red curtains. Two
                        Turkish ladies, wives of officers at Ma’ân, were behind the curtain attended
                        by a coloured maid and a little boy. No one treated them with any thing but
                        the strictest politeness, and one Arab, who I think must have been the
                        soldier servant of one of the officers, put goulehs of water in through the
                        curtain from time to time, and when we reached the grassland, gathered
                        flowers by the track and handed in rough nosegays. He also acted as nursery
                        governess to a small boy who ran in and out of the "harem” end of the
                        carriage and chattered fearlessly to the Bedouins, who were hugely pleased,
                        and asked him if he would care to come and live with them in the desert.</p>
                    <p>One incident which amused me greatly happened about 40 minutes north of Jurf
                        el Derwish. We were descending an inCline with three sharpish curves where
                        the brake was usually put hard down. But the brakesman had curled himself
                        under a seat and we had taken the incline at the alarming speed of 15 miles
                        an hour. The guard suddenly realised the situation. He screeched at the
                        greaser and prodded him with a bayonet, he dragged him from under the seat,
                        and flung him on to the brake at the end of the carriage amidst a variety of
                        curses. We took the next two curves much more quietly.</p>
                    <p>At Katranéh the Circassians got into the train. They were perhaps a dozen of
                        the finest-looking msn I have ever seen, tall, clean-limbed, aud as a rule
                        curiously fair. They looked far more like Germans or Swedes than Orientals,
                        aud the imagined contrast between these men and the childish and noisy
                        fellaheen of the type one meets too often in Egypt was painful. These men
                        were the very antipodes of the Egyptian in their quiet manner, their air of
                        alert repose, and above all in the way they eyed the people who were to
                        travel with them. There was none of the rustic cheeriness of the fellah,
                        nothing of the somewhat artificial manner of the Gallicised Bey or Effendi
                        of Egypt. These people were simply well-bred cowboys with just a touch of
                        truculeuoe in their walk and the look of their eyes. One of the Bedouins
                        woke up while the Sharaksa were getting into their places, and said
                        something to his friend which was obviously insulting to the new comers. A
                        Circassian heard and turned round, turned away, and turned again on the
                        Bedonin smiling unpleasantly with half a snarl on his lips. As he smiled he
                        played with his revolver. The Bedouin glared angrily at him for a moment or
                        two and then his gaze dropped before those merciless blue eyes aud he looked
                        first at the floor and then at nothing. The Circassian turned and talked
                        quietly with his fellow troopers, now and again looking back, but the
                        Bedouin did not watch him anymore but lay back on his seat and looked at the
                        steppe.</p>

                    <p>Cotons.—Au soutien relatif du matin a succédé une accalmie assez prononcée,
                        surtout sur le novembre, qui nous a fait reculer encore davantage en
                        clôture. Liverpool n'est pas du tout encourageant et l'on craint la
                        continuation de la baisse actuelle sur les Américains.</p>
                    <p>Graines de coton.—Il y a eu revirement complet dans la tenue du marché et la

                    <dateline>London, June 7.</dateline>
                    <p>Queen Alexandra's visit to the Royal Botanic was “roses all the way,” and,
                        so, exceptional from a meteorological point of view. As a rule, the
                        rose-reign in the Regent’s Park means rainfall. Her Majesty may remember
                        less pleasant experiences. Rain or shine, however, the appearance of a Queen
                        at the Botanic has been rare. On the other hand, a King once had a notion of
                        building himself a palace there. This was when the King was George IV., and
                        the present gardens were in the occupation of a market-gardener, who had
                        been allowed, for a while, to hold his market-garden under the Crown. The
                        idea of a Palace in the Park fell through, as had done the more ambitious
                        scheme which aimed at crowning Primrose Hill with a Royal residence, and the
                        cutting of a Royal road therefrom straight down to what is now Piccadilly
                        Circus. Portland-place is a bit of that road. But the market-gardener made
                        way for the Botanic Society, in 1839 ; and, on the whole, perhaps, the
                        Regent’s Park is better as it is. </p>
                    <p>To-night's State ball is a function in which, it is contemplated, some 2,000
                        people will take part. The accommodation at Buckingham Palace has grown
                        since the early Victorian days, and the invitation list has become more
                        comprehensive. This is not the only difference. Sixty years ago the State
                        Ball of the season was of the fancy-costume order. “All the elderly people
                        of both sexes were occupied in dressing-up, and in practising steps in one
                        house after another.” They were exclusive at the Lord Chamberlain’s Office. </p>
                    <p>“Brougham,” Mr. Greville remarks, “was not invited. He was furious. He got up
                        in the Lords, and twitted Prince Albert about Barry and the Houses of
                        Parliament. They had to ask him to dinner to appease him.” If a modern Lord
                        Chancellor did not get asked to a State Ball, he would not be apt to get
                        asked to a Royal dinner-party by twitting. </p>
                    <p>Lord Kenmare, who has provided the site at Killarney for a Memorial of the
                        Irish soldiers who fell in South Africa, has a family connection with
                        Killarney that goes back to the date of his 1620 baronetcy. The original
                        Irish viscounty of Kenmare was one of the seven Irish peerages created by
                        James II. when he was no longer King of England, but while he was still King
                        of Ireland. All these dignities are still on the Rolls. Three Viscounts
                        Kenmare of the 1689 creation followed the grantee, Sir Valentine Browne. The
                        only son and heir of the fourth, another Sir Valentine, became Viscount
                        Kenmare of a new creation in 1799, and Earl of Kenmare in 1801. To him the
                        second and third earls owed their title, and the fourth earl was born to the
                        younger of these brothers. With Killarney House go 91,000 acres out of a
                        total of 118,000 or 119,000. </p>
                    <p>Considering his long connection with Cambridge, it is only natural that the
                        appointment of Dr. Chase to the Bishopric of Ely should be received with
                        lively satisfaction in the University town. After a distinguished career at
                        Christ's College, he returned in 1879 as curate of St. Michael’s, and has
                        been ever since intimately associated with Cambridge. Following his
                        appointment as Lecturer in Theology at Pembroke College, he became the First
                        Tutor and later the Principal of the Cambridge Clergy Training School, a
                        position he held until four years ago, when he was elected President of
                        Queens’ College in succession to Dr. Ryle. His selection in 1902 as
                        Vice-Chancellor was more than justified by the powers of government and of
                        organisation he has displayed.</p>
                    <p>Among all the noble works in which medical science is engaged there is none
                        more praiseworthy than that of the Imperial Cancer <cb n="2"/>Research Fund.
                        Cancer is not only one of the most terrible of human maladies, it is one of
                        those diseases which, for unknown reasons, are increasing rather than
                        decreasing. Until quite recently the only thing that we knew about cancer
                        was that we knew nothing at all. That is no longer true. The Prince of Wales
                        was able to tell the annual meeting of the Fund, yesterday, that “one result
                        obtained shows that cancer is not transferable from one individual to
                        another as if it were an infectious disease,” although malignant growths can
                        be transplanted from mice to other mice. It is something, surely, to know
                        that cancer is not infections. Much progress has also been made, the Prince
                        of Wales said, by the rejection of fallacies which had obscured the true
                        problem to be solved. Research is now in less danger than it was, three
                        years ago, of wandering off into the impasse of this or that tempting, but
                        delusive, path of experiment. Thus, slowly, and with much stumbling, science
                        struggles towards the light. </p>
                    <p>Much irrelevant opposition has been directed against the scheme for supplying
                        electricity in bulk to a large area in London and the home counties which is
                        to be considered by the House of Commons this evening. Epithets of
                        “monopoly” and “trust” have been thrown at it, with the object of misleading
                        public and Parliamentary opinion as to the aim of its promoters, and the
                        bill is in danger of being sacrificed to the combined effects of ignorant
                        suspicion and prejudice. The interests of existing suppliers in the
                        scheduled area are affected, of course, but only to a small extent, as these
                        are vendors of current for lighting principally, whereas the principal
                        object of the promoters and the Administrative County of London and District
                        Company is to supply current for power purposes, and at a price far below
                        what that current can be produced by the lighting companies for. The
                        company’s bill ought to have a fair hearing before a Committee. </p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped that Colonel Lockwood, and the members associated with him,
                        will be strongly supported, this afternoon, in their efforts to obtain
                        redress for the grievances of the District Messenger Company. The occasion
                        is the consideration of the Post Office Estimates, and there can be no
                        possible doubt in any but the purely Departmental mind that the Post Office
                        way of dealing with the District Messengers is not conducive either to
                        economy or to the public convenience. To put the case briefly, the Post
                        Office has done its best to prevent the company from doing for the public
                        what the Post Office itself tries to do, but cannot. The Post Office
                        service, which competes with the company’s, is run at unremunerative rates,
                        and the Post Office uses its own legal position as a vantage ground from
                        which to prevent the company from improving the efficiency of its service,
                        and to deprive it of business which it has had for the past fourteen years.
                        This is a dog-in-the manger policy which is unworthy of a public Department
                        that exists—or should exist— solely for the benefit of the public. </p>
                    <p>Actions for literary libel are always difficult to argue before a jury, and
                        in the case of Mr. Moy Thomas and Mr. Lucy the judge seems to have been
                        discreet in expounding a broad rule and leaving the twelve good men and true
                        to fit the facts to it for themselves. The reviewer may attack the book as
                        hard as he likes, provided that he does not attack the author, and it is
                        also incumbent on him to see that he does not deliver a personal stroke
                        without realising that he is doing so. This is, perhaps, what befel Mr.
                        Lucy. His relations with Mr. Thomas being “on the north side of friendly,”
                        expressions crept into his work which carried further than his deliberate
                        intention, and an unfortunate slip in the witness-box went to corroborate
                        this explanation. It is difficult to divide the mind into compartments and
                        prevent personal impressions from affecting the literary judgment, and where
                        there is the slightest consciousness of antipathy to-<cb n="3"/>wards an
                        author, it is better, perhaps, to decline the responsibility of criticising
                        his achievement.</p>
                    <p>It is not often that troops allow themselves to be carried away by the
                        realistic nature of manœuvres, as the Dragoons at Aldershot were yesterday.
                        It appears that the Dragoons got so excited that they actually charged the
                        Guards Brigade, who were fighting a rear guard action, and slashed at them
                        with their swords. A scene of indescribable confusion prevailed; but
                        fortunately no casualties occurred, though a sergeant of the Scots Guards
                        had the foresight of his rifle cut off. Another incident of this nature
                        happened a good many years ago near the same place, the Fox Hills, when two
                        infantry regiments charged each other with fixed bayonets, and were only
                        prevented from using their weapons on each other by their officers
                        intervening and striking up their rifles.</p>
                    <p>The persistence of the famous Cock-lane ghost, which was laid to rest nearly
                        a century and a half ago, is rather surprising, more especially as the
                        method of its laying was proof that it was not a ghost at all but the tricks
                        of a young girl. Experts in spook lore will be able, possibly, to explain
                        how this disproved ghost has been able now to return to its old haunt, or
                        rather to Saracen House, Snow Hill, which occupies the site of that haunt.
                        Things have changed a good deal since Dr. Johnson’s time, when the ghost
                        used merely to knock. Thinking, presumably, that it was about to revisit the
                        glimpses of the moon, it must have been shocked to find electric light,
                        incandescent gas, and such new-fangled illuminants. We learn from the “Daily
                        Mail” that the house was carefully locked up the other evening, and then
                        found by the police with the door open and the electric light switched on.
                        They telephoned for the proprietor, but the ghost was not “done” even by
                        such a novelty as the telephone. When the owner arrived, all was darkness
                        again, and there was no sign of any forcing of the door or tampering with
                        the look. A week or two ago the ghost dropped some heavy weight in an upper
                        room, which smashed the incandescent mantles downstairs, but nothing was
                        found in that upper room. For a ghost exploded in the eighteenth century all
                        this is pretty fair.</p>

                    <head type="sub">Fell Unconscious With the Violent Pain in his Back.</head>
                    <p>40 Freehold Street, York Road, Leeds, England.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sirs :—I cannot find words to express my gratitude for the good your
                        Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have done me. They have indeed saved my life. I
                        am sure you will be interested in my case, and I will describe it to you as
                        well as I can :— </p>
                    <p>In 1893 I had a man in, doing some work in the garden. After a hearty dinner
                        I took a stroll down to see how he was getting on. I had never felt better
                        in my life than I did then. But suddenly a most agonising pain darted
                        through my back, and I came over so dizzy that I swayed to and fro, and
                        should have fallen to the ground if my son-in-law hadn’t come up just in
                        time and caught me. I fell into his arms unconscions, and was taken to bed.
                        The doctor who was summoned called in the best physician in Leeds, to
                        consult with him over the case, and together they decided it was acute
                        Bright’s disease. </p>
                    <p>For three weeks I was semi-conscious, and was nourished almost entirely by
                        liquids. When at last I came to myself I ached in every bone, and the pain
                        in my back was simply cruel. The kidney secretions were foul and
                        highly-coloured, and I felt thoroughly worn out. For six weeks I was
                        dangerously ill, but the clever doctors pulled me through, and I was so much
                        better that I could get about a little after a while. Later on, however, I
                        had another terrible seizure, and off and on from that time the least cold
                        or chill has told on my back and kidneys, making my life a misery. </p>
                    <p>Now, your Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have proved just my medicine; before I
                        had finished the first box I was beginning to mend ; my kidneys were easier
                        than they had been ever since 1903, and I felt brighter and better. I
                        therefore dropped the doctor’s medicine, and used Doan’s Pills persistently
                        and solely. Now I am able to say that my back is as strong as ever it was. I
                        cannot speak too highly of your medicine, and I gladly give you permission
                        to publish my letter, </p>
                    <p>Believe me, yours faithfully, </p>
                    <p>(signed) George Whitaker.</p>
                    <p>Writing <hi rend="italic">some weeks later</hi>, Mr. Whitaker said: “Use my
                        testimonial wherever you like. I am not ashamed for people to know what your
                        medicine has done for me, and I will gladly answer any inquiries about my
                        cure. I have never found anything so good and reliable as Doan's Backache

                        Limassol, Cyprus (one company), and Crete (three companies), will be carried
                        out in February, those companies returning to the headquarters at Cairo, on
                        being relieved by companies from Cairo. </p>
                    <p>Captain H. B. Protheroe-Smith, 21st Lancers, and Lieut. B. A. P. Schreiber,
                        20th Hussars, have been appointed to the Military Mounted Police in Egypt. </p>
                    <p>Lieutenant C. J. Johstone, 4th Battalion Rifle Brigade, latterly doing duty
                        with the Rifle Depot at Winchester, has resigned his commission after a
                        little over five years’ service in the “Green Jackets.” </p>
                    <p>Amongst the officers who recently passed in musketry at Hythe
                        were—Lieutenants F.W.L. Edwards, King’s Royal Rifle Corps ; G. A.
                        Dick-Cunyngham, Rifle Brigade ; Lieutenants J. G. Devenish and G. M.
                        Jennings, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers ; Lieutenant C. F. De S. Murphy and
                        Second Lieutenant E. T. W. M’Causland, Royal Berkshire Regiment. </p>
                    <p>Another distinguished name disappears from the active list of the Navy with
                        the voluntary retirement of Vice-Admiral John William Brackenbury, C.B.,
                        C.M.G., who for the best part of half a century has done good service in all
                        parts of the world. As commander of the “Shah’s” Naval Brigade during the
                        campaign against Cetewayo in 1879, he will be best remembered for the
                        prominent part he took in the relief of Ekowe and the battle of Gingilovo.
                        In 1882 he was present in Egypt throughout the Arabi Pasha insurrection, and
                        in 1890 formed one of the punitive expedition sent against the Sultan of
                        Witu. For two years he had charge of the naval establishments at Bermuda,
                        and in 1898 was appointed econd in command of the Channel Squadron </p>
                    <p>The battleship New Zealand, one of the King Edward VII. type, will be
                        commissioned for service in the Atlantic Fleet after the visit to Brest,
                        taking the place of the Prince George, which in turn will replace the
                        Hannibal in the Channel Fleet. </p>
                    <p>Everything naval points to a tremendous concentration of force in home
                        waters. The fatuous policy recently pursued by the Kaiser is the cause of
                        England making such preparations. This country in its present mood intends
                        to take no risks that can be forestalled.</p>

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
