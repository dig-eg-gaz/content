                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to

                        pleasing colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it
                        lends itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing
                        all the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                        <p>St. Petersburg, September 1. An official communication in relating the
                            history of the peace negotiations, confirms that, at the moment when a
                            rupture seemed imminent, President Roosevelt appealed to the Tsar's
                            humanitarian sentiments, and beg- ged him to accept th8 new Japanese
                            proposal that Russia should pay Japan twelve hundred million yen for
                            northern Saghalien. The Tsar rejected this proposal, whereupon Japan re-
                            nounced the re-imbnrsement of expenses and claimed southern Saghalien,
                            undertaking not to fortify it, nor to take any military measures to keep
                            La Perouse Straits closed. The effect the publication of the terms of
                            peace will produce on the Japanese publio is awaited with impatience,
                            and the apprehension is expressed that possibly the work of the
                            conference may be destroyed. (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>The Reopening.of the Schools —Not only by the young scholars, who vies the
                        prospect with regret, is this fact-to be considered, but also by those to
                        whom a knowledge of English, French, German, Arabic, and Greek is every day
                        more necessary. All naturally enter their names at the Berlitz Schools
                        (Alexandria and Cairo) whore the number of pupils belonging to the highest
                        social positions increases from day to. day. 26381-1</p>

                    <p>The Post Office.—The oontinual increase in the demand for house to house
                        delivery in Cairo and Alexandria renders it absolutely necessary that all
                        persons in these towns desirous of suoh delivery shall have the number of
                        the house and name of the street in which they live indicated on their
                        correspondence. Should by any chance a street be unnamed, then the quarter
                        of the town in which it is situated must be indicated. Attention to these
                        instruotioDS is imperative to avoid delay and °rrors in the delivery of
                        correspondence. A Record of the Eclipse.—We have receiv- ed from M. Reiser,
                        photographer, an excellent record of the partial eolipse of the sun at Alex-
                        andria in the form of a photograph which gives au accurate impression of
                        Jtbe phenomenon as viewed from here. The sun appears as a small orescent
                        surrounded in its immediate neigh- boured by an irregular sphere of light.
                        The degree of darkuess is of course somewhat exaggerated on aocount of the
                        lens of the camera having t6 be darkened so that a defined impression of the
                        main objeot might be obtain- ed, bnt the appearance of the sea is very
                        faithfully portrayed.</p>
                    <p>Throughout yesterday the Cairo streets presented an appearanoe of exceptional
                        gaiety, both from the profuse deooration of almost every building and from
                        the large number of people who seemed to be making holiday in honor of the
                        great event of the celebration of the twenty-ninth anniversary of the
                        Sultan’s accession. To attempt any description of the deco rations would be
                        to repeat an oft-told tale; they were very similar to those whioh wo have
                        seen on many other occasions, with, perk aps, the exception that they were
                        rather more extensive than usual, for the gene- ral feeling prevailed that
                        the occasion should be one of exceptional rejoicing on account of his
                        Majesty’s happy escape from the dastardly plot against his life. Business
                        was carried on as usual in commercial circles, but the dosing of the
                        Ministries and public offices greatly increased the numbers seen in the
                        streets during the day time. As the day progressed the crowds grew larger,
                        and shortly after half past seven, the Esbakieh Gardens, in which the great
                        festivities were to be held, were lit up, and many of the principal
                        buildings were also most? effectively illuminated and afforded an
                        exceedingly bril- liant appearance.</p>
                    <p>The gardens were thrown open to the publio at 9 p.m. and the view on entering
                        was excel- lent A special approaoh to the reception tent was lined with
                        lamps, Chinese lanterns were mng between these, while the red of the Turkish
                        and Egyptian flags was to be seen everywhere.</p>
                    <p>It is needless to say that huge crowds as- sembled to assist at the
                        festivities; the gardens seemed to be one mass of people, and the tents and
                        booths of entertainment were orowded to their utmost oapaoity. Suoh a crowd
                        was easily roused to enthusiasm by singers, danoers, tumblers, and
                        contortionists, and good-humour prevailed everywhere. Military music and the
                        noise of tom-toms and various other native instruments greeted the ear
                        wherever one turn- ed, and at times the noise was almost deafening.
                        Excellent order was maintained both inside and outride the gardens, and in
                        spite of the groat crowds, many of whose members were every m 'ment in peril
                        of being run over by arsbeah s frequently passing backwards and forwards, no
                        acoidents, bo far as we are aware, have been reported. The police, under the
                        direction cf the aoting commandant, are to be congratulated on the manner in
                        which they insured the publio safety.</p>

                    <p>The twenty-ninth anniversary of the acces- sion of H.I.M. the Sultan was
                        officially oalebrated by a banquet given last night at Rrjs el Tin Palace
                        by, H.E. Fakhry Pasha, the acting Regent. Among the guests we— tba.
                        Ministers, the British Chargd d’Affaires and the members of tl*e Consular
                        and Diplomatic Corps,' the Commissioners of the Caisse de la Dette, the
                        Aoting Advisers and Under-Seore- tarios of State, the Heads of
                        Administrations, the Officer Commanding the Army of Occupa- tion, etc. The
                        Palace had been brilliant- ly doooiatod for the occasion, the Aida was very
                        prettily and effectively hung with lanterns, and the Abd el Moneim from time
                        to time throw her searchlight over the water on to the palace. After tbe
                        banquet oame a very flue display of fireworks, whioh lasted till about 10
                        p.m., oulminating in the discharge of a huge sheaf of rockets, whioh lit up
                        the whole harbour, first with rose and green and then with golden and purple
                        light</p>
                    <p>The Khedivial Yacht Club was lit up, and the fifty diners on the verandah had
                        an admirable view, whilo a good band and an oxcollent dinner specially
                        prepared for the occasion made the evening very agreeable. After dinner tho
                        fireworks oould be seen admirably from the olub jetty, and few of the
                        members loft the olub honse till long after midnight.</p>
                    <p>Elsewhere on the shore both the Coast Guard station and Custom House were
                        decorated and the Ottoman Bank and Gonvernorat were illuminated with
                        hundreds of small lamps, that formed among other patterns the star anc
                        crescent of the Turkish Empire. Turkish musio, or what we believe to have
                        been Turkish music, was played by a military band near the Gonvernorat and
                        some speoial performances were given at various musio halls which attract-
                        ed large audienoes.</p>
                    <p>The Ras el Tin road was orowded by persons anxious to witnoss the fireworks,
                        and native Alexandria as a rule retired late to bed.</p>

                        of L.E. 226 in favour of the former week. The receipts from October J, 1904

                    <p>The “Journal du Cairo" has recsived a com- munication from the Socidtd des
                        Suoreries et de la Raffilerie d’Egypte, whioh we give in English and French
                        owing to its great import- ant to the public, to the effeot that as soon as
                        th% death of M. Cronier was known at Paris, the Administrative Board met to
                        discuss the situation. MM. Barois, Laronx, de la Bouglise and Dorison were
                        present and Sir Elwin Palmer and Sir E. Cassel also attended the meeting,
                        their functions being purely advisory. In oonsequeuoe of the advioe of these
                        gentle- men and of Me. Barboux and Me Carton de Wiart, who were also
                        present, the Board has given orders to the Cairo headquarters of the
                        3ncreries d’Egypte to publish the balance sheet up to date as soon as
                        possible. M. Girard, the chief accountant of the company, has therefore >een
                        recalled from leave and will arrive at Cairo next Tuesday. The balance sheet
                        will be published in the course of next week.</p>

                        Journal du Cairo”, the Hon. A. Davey made the following statement. ’Even
                        should M. Cronier have fraudulently pledged the company’s credit, which is
                        still a pure hypothesis, we have every reason to hope that the crisis will
                        terminate happily and that nothing will justify the fears of some
                        alarmist,’. Our advice to the publio— the only advioe we can give, under the
                        circum- stances—is to wait for more news from Paris as calmly as possible It
                        may not be exhilarating, but it is the only possible course.</p>

                    <head>THE ECLIPSE AT ASSOUAN. INTERESTING ACCOUNT.</head>
                    <p>One of the spectators has kindly famished as with the following interesting
                        account of the eclipse as seen from the roof of the Savoy Hotel, Assouan
                        :—</p>
                    <p>After 8nme discussion as to where to go to see the 6clipse at Asrouan,
                        whether it would be best to mount a hill on the west bank, hang abont one of
                        the missions or go on to the roof of the hotel, we settled on the roof as
                        eaeier to climb than the hill and nearer to refreshments than either of the
                        others. As it turned out, it was an excellent place to see it from. A field
                        glass, with the object glasses smoked, and a separate blue glass, formed an
                        easy and efficient means of seeing the eolipee from a layman’s point 'of
                        view, and allowed two sun spots to be easily distinguished. Mounting on the
                        roof one saw the first oontact whioh took place oh the south east-comer of
                        the rim cf the sun. In watching the different phases for an hour or so until
                        totality, it was interesting to remark the decreasing glare and heat as the
                        sun became more covered, but np to the very last a smoked lens was necessary
                        ou the field glasses.</p>
                    <p>When almost half covered, the effect on the landscape was as if one was
                        looking through blue glass. A strange effeot, very easy to notice when once
                        seen, was that rayB of light when broken by branches of trees, etc. would
                        not appear to be made up of multitudes of circles of the same form as the
                        sun, which is how we always see the m, bnt they were made up of multitudes
                        of crescents of the same form as the partially eclipsed sun. This was bast
                        seen where the rays were thrown on a wall which had been broken up by straw
                        matting with which a window was entirely oovered.</p>
                    <p>The period of totality, which lasted about two and a half minutes, was
                        intensely interest- ing .and all too soon over, there was so much to look
                        out for in such a short time. ? The shadow bauds, whioh occur just before
                        and just after totality were seen well on a sheet hung on a wall.</p>
                    <p>When most clearly defiaed they appeared as parallel bands of light and dark
                        shadows about four inohes wide. They seemed clearest just after they were
                        observed, both before and after totality, and gradually faded away. They
                        moved across the sheet in a second or two in the same direction as the
                        shadow of the moon passed across the sun, and were inclined at about right
                        angles to the inclination of its path.</p>
                    <p>No sooner was the snn entirely covered than an orange-red eroption was
                        remarkable at the 8pot where the light of the snn was last seen; this
                        gradually diminished in size and di- sappeared. A similar spot, observed a
                        few seconds before totality was over at a point diametrically opposite to
                        that mentioned above, which increased in sizs until it was absorbed, in the
                        light of the snn.</p>
                    <p>The oorona, which is a halo of light round the eolipse with loDg rays
                        shooting from it, appeared as canary-yellow for a depth of about one tenth
                        of the sun’s diameter and faded off into an irregularly shaped cross whose
                        longest arm was two or three snn diameters. The ap- pearanoe of these arms
                        was that of thin wind- tom clouds on a background of inky blue, the eolipse
                        itself appearing absolutely black. The totality phase was, so far, more
                        interest- ing than the phases where the sun was slowly being covered and the
                        hot roof of the hotel was deserted soon after totality, refreshments being
                        found to be more interesting than watching the sun reassert itself.</p>
                    <p>Of the Boientifio instruments the “oross-eyed lady” belonging to the Amerioan
                        expedition o tiled forth most remarks. It oonserted of four telescopes
                        ooupled up so that eaoh gave a large plate photograph of a quarter of the
                        sun’s sur- face. It required seven men to work it, one to change each plate
                        half way through totality, one to put on the ‘ oap,” one to count the time
                        on a pendulum, and one to give the word to the plate changers. This took a
                        deal of rehears- ing to get the four plates obanged together in the shortest
                        possible time, and the “dress rehearsal” was given the evening before in
                        twilight, approximately that expeoted at the eclipse, when the plates were
                        ohanged in eight seconds.</p>
                    <p>All the telescopes gave photographio records, and they or the rtHectors were
                        kept bearing on the sun by clockwork. They were mostly placed horizontally,
                        the sun’s image being re- flected into them.</p>

                    <p>In continuation of my report on the partial eolipse as seen from here, 1
                        might add that the actual amount of the son’s disc whioh was obscured
                        amounted to 27'30'. This is the degree as measured by a good sextant, and, I
                        should say, is at any rate approximately accurate. Another point of interest
                        whioh I might remark on is the fact that, in spile of a southerly wind,
                        whioh ordinarily lowen the depth of water at this part of the ooast, this
                        morning there were 37 am. more water at the guages than normal; and it is
                        probable the same phenomenon will be noticeable during some days yet, in a
                        gradually diminiahing degree.</p>

                            broking, but the employes of the post office, and espe- cially those of
                            the Mixed Tribunal, are to a very large extent implioated, and it is
                            quite time for the authorities to intervene and put a stop to suoh
                            dealings, by insisting upon their employes adhering to the rules, and

                            and very often spoil a transaction half oonoloded. 'Government should,

                    <p>The new appointment of Lord Minto serves to give prominence to teh fact that
                        in his brother, the Hon. Arthur Elliott, he has a distinguished opponent of
                        the fiscal reform of which he is an enthusiastic supporter. This is the more
                        interesting from the circumstance that Lord Lanadowne, one of his Viceregal
                        predecessors, finds himself in like cae, Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice being a
                        particularly active Lieral. Families are much divided now-a-days. We see
                        Lord Tweedmouth criticising the speeches of his nephew, the Duke of
                        ariborough, and Mr. Victor Cavendish, the Duke of Devonshire's heir and
                        nephew, assailing the arguments of his uncle. The Palmer brothers vote in
                        different lobbies; and while Sir Edgar Vincent proposes an anti-reform
                        resolution on the fiscal question, Sir Howard, his brother, is the man to
                        move the amendment to it.</p>
