					<head>WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1905. RUSSIAN EXPANSION. </head>
					<p>The belief, so prevalent among the many sympathisers with the Russian liberal
						party, that the establishment of some form of con- stitutional government in
						Russia will be the end of the antouratic policy of expansion towards the
						open water, seems to us to be a pleasing but dangerous delusion. That Russia
						will not pursue an aggressive policy in the Near or Far East for some years
						to come seems certain. The giant may have the will but he has not the
						strength for distant adventures, and some year may be expected to elapse
						before be begins to move. But that Russia, under any government but that of
						Count Tolstoi’s followers, will feel the need for an outlet on the open tea,
						appears to us to be an absolute certainty. The average Russian may not have
						felt any great interest in a campaign in Mancharia but the war against
						Turkey in 1877 was supported by the whole nation and the “will of Peter the
						great” it gospel to numbers of Russians, who are by no means devoted to the
						autocracy. That Russia is moving, though slowly, towards reform is in-
						dubitable but a “reformed" Government, even if unwilling to risk war, might
						conceivably find the trend of national feeling too strong to be resisted. A
						nation does not make its policy. Its policy is imposed on it by geogra-
						phical conditions and statesman can no more adopt a policy that does not aim
						at teaching the open water than English statesmen can forget that their
						country is an insular power, or German Chancellors can forget that their
						Empire contains an expanding population rapidly becoming industrial and
						doomed, unless useful colonies can be seised, bought or other wise acquired,
						to depend very largely on foreign supplies. The whole external history of
						England from Tudor times is the history of a struggle for maritime
						supremacy. The whole of recent Russian history is the record of an excentric
						movement towards the seas. In the 15th century Russia had no seaboard beyond
						a strip on the Arctic Ocean—since then she has reached three dosed seas—the
						Baltic, the Black Sea and the Caspian, but has not yet attained her
						goal-open, ice-free water in touch with the world's trade. Reform will not
						lead directly to aggression but there cannot be the slightest doubt that it
						will vastly increase the aggressive strength of the Empire. Even revo-
						lution may well have the same result—France was immeasureably stronger in
						1796 than she ever showed herself under the greatest of the Bourbon
						kings</p>

							and delight the audience with their vivacity and original dancing. Last
							night they were loudly applaud- ed and encored several times, especially
							for the manner in which they danced the cake- walk. Miss Cissie Davies,
							the youngest of the trio, also sings solos and greatly delighted the
							several English soldiers who were present with her rendering of "British
							Boys," and other patriotic songs. A fourth member is shortly to be added

							town feverish preparations are in evidence. The hotels in particular,
							waking from their comatose state, rival one another in the excel- lence
							of their intentions and internal splendour. Foremost amongst these must
							be mentioned the old established Hotel du Nil. Luxurious as have always
							been the arrangements and management of this renowned hotel, no pains or
							expense have been spared during the past summer in endeavouring to
							improve the al- ready excellent interior and thus place the Hotel du Nil
							on a throughly up-to-date foot- ing in very respect. Apart from the
							elaborate repainting, papering, etc. which has been in progress at the
							Hotel du Nil we are obliged to drawn attention to the new arrangements
							that have been made in regard to the opening of a first class restaurant
							and bar ; a want which has often been felt. There is no doubt that this
							will attract all who know what good cooking and palatial surroundings
							mean. The drawing and music rooms etc. just opened cannot fall to draw
							an even greater number of guests than heretofore.</p>

					<head>A SCENE AT WARDIAN. RIOT NARROWLY AVERTED.</head>
					<p>Disturbances which might have culminated in serious rioting took place near
						Wardian, Alex- andria, yesterday forenoon. It appears that a body of
						labourers employed by the Ports and Lights Administration on the harbour
						works to the east of the abattoir, while engaged in laying rails for the
						transport of material were sum- moned to stop work by a number of the in-
						habitants of the quarter. The interference was caused by a number of the
						occupants of houses fronting the road on which the rails were being laid,
						who grew nervous about the safety of their houses, the founda- tions of
						which were threatened by the excava- tions of the working parties, and not
						having been informed that they would receive full compensation for any
						damage done, decided to take the law into their own hands and stop all
						work.</p>
					<p>In this they succeeded. After a slight souffle the workmen ceased their
						digging but the crowd had assumed dangerous proportions and a general affray
						seemed probable, when the acting Commandant of Police with a body of mounted
						policemen opportunely arrived on the scene and put a stop to the disturbance
						by arresting fifteen ringleaders of the mob who are now detained under
						preventive imprison- ment in the caracol. A substitute of the Parquet opened
						an enquiry at Minet el Bassal yesterday and measures have been taken to
						acquaint the inhabitants of the quarter with the fact that they will be com-
						pensated for any damage done by the laying of the rails. Work has been
						suspended to-day as a precautionary measure but will be resum- ed to-morrow
						morning if all goes well.</p>

					<head>THE SUCRERIES.</head>
					<p>We hear that it has proved impossible to find un agricultural expert to

						investigating the books and examining the material of the company, but it is
						not expected that they will be in a position to furnish the meeting of
						creditors to be held on the 4th prox. with anythiug like a detailed
						statement of the actual position of the Societe des Suc- reries. It is
						therefore not improbable that the meeting may be adjourned.</p>
					<p>Judge Tuck has confirmed the Hon. A. J. Davey’s position as acting manager of
						the business of the Sucreries under the control of Sir Elwin Palmer, Harari
						Pasha, and M.Deboorg, the three assessors previously appointed. Harari
						Pasha, who arrived at Cairo yesterday confered with the Hon. A. J. Davey and

					<head>MURDER IN THE FAYOUM.</head>
					<p>At about 9. p.m. on the 23rd. inst. M. Isaac Matalon, a young and promising
						agricul- tural engineer employed by Messrs. Green was killed by three shots
						fired at short range at Tarnish near Senouris in the Fayoum province. As far
						as is known revenge was the motive of the crime, the body of the victim,
						according to the accounts that have reached us, having been left unplundered
						by the murderer or murderers. At Fayoum rumours were current that an
						important landowner with whom the late M. Matalon had had certain
						differences of opinion had been arrested on suspicion of having committed,
						or aided and abetted the murder, but we understand from our corres- pondents
						that a discharged employe recently expelled from Messrs. Green’s service for
						theft is believed to be the real culprit and is being searched for by the
						police. The Mudir of the Faynum with the Commandant of Police have visited
						the scene of the crime and it is hoped that an arrest will speedily be
						effected. The late M. Matalon was considered by all who knew him to be a
						yonng man of great intelli- gence and promise and great sympathy will be

					<head>THE CHATHAM EXPLOSION.</head>
					<byline>(From our Port Suez Correspondent).</byline>
					<p>Port Said, Tuesday. The experts met at Ras el Esh station on Tuesday morning
						to superintend the re- moval of the high explosives which had been sent for
						especially from Alexandria, where Messrs. Nobels have an enormous stock of
						the newest forms of explosive material. The train, which I believe had been
						especially ordered by the authorities to assist matters, arrived at 11 a.m.
						and the ton and a half of red dyna- mite and blasting gelatine was removed
						at once without accident, put into a special dahabieh with a house on deck,
						and carried at once to the tents arranged for its reception on the Asian
						shore.</p>
					<p>The party then proceeded accompanied by Mr. Plum, the chief electrician of
						the Canal Company, to set wires and make practical test trials of the power
						of the battery current. Mr. Harris attached small detonators in pairs to the
						wires intended to be used on Thursday and made repeated trials with the
						switches and various combinations of cells using only a few yards of
						wire,the idea being that if the detonat- ors fired easily at Ras el Esh,
						close to the batteries the power would only be required to be slightly
						augmented to fire similar detona- tors over four kilometres away. The
						required number of cells being found, the telephone wires connecting with
						Port Said were out and the power of the battery increased slightly. Mr.
						Harris then proceeded to kilometer 19 and cut the wires there, attaching to
						them a submarine cable etc. such as would be used at the actual explosion,
						and also fitted the same number of fuses. Then by a system of signals,
						evidently prepared before hand, the fuses were fired from Ras el Esh as was
						pre- viously done with the few yards of wiring at the station. Slight
						modifications, were found necessary, but finally all was found to work
						satisfactorily, and the wires and power were considered sufficient for the
						great event. The party returned to Port Said at a late hour leaving guards
						over the magazine after having once more coupled up the telephone wires,
						thus restoring communication between Port Said and the southern
						stations.</p>

					<head>RAILWAY ADMINISTRATION. HISTORICAL SUMMARY.</head>
					<p>The following are some of the general conclusions of the directors in their
						report for 1904, which may be said to give a histori- cal summary of railway
						administration in Egypt. This summary gives the reader a com- prehensive
						view of the development of the Egyptian State Railways since 1877 and is of
						such importance to all who are interested in the economic history and
						progress of the country that it deserves to be reproduced in extenso. The
						following is the text:-</p>
					<p>The year 1904 was an important epoch in the history of the management of the
						Rail- ways, the Telegraphs and the Port of Alex- andria. On 28th November,
						1904, a Khedivial decree was promulgated, with the concurrence of the
						European powers concerned,under which the earnings of this administration
						cease, from 1st January, 1906, to form a guarantee for the Egyptian
						Privileged debt: and the decree under which the existing system of manage-
						ment exists was repealed. From 1st January, 1905,therefore, the receipts of
						this Administra- tion with those of other Public Departments are paid direct
						to the Ministry of Finance in place of being paid to the Commissioners of
						the Public Debt, and the Government has sole control of its expenditure. A
						further decree of 23rd March, 1905, separates the Port of Alexandria from
						the Railway and Telegraph Department, and combines it with the Ports and
						Lighthouses Administration under the Ministry of Finance, while the Railways
						and Telegraph remain a department of the Ministry of Public Works. We will
						therefore briefly describe the phases through which this Admi- nistration
						has passed.</p>
					<p>The principal decrees on which its organisa- tion has been based are as
						follows:—</p>
					<p>1— That of 18th November, 1876, which created a board of management composed
						of 5 directors, two of them British, one French, and two Egyptian: and
						provided that its receipts should be paid to the Commissioners of the Public
						Debt to defray the interest on certain loans.</p>
					<p>2— The decree of 25th December, 1879, reduced the number of Directors to
						three, one of each nationality, and provided that the British Director
						should be Chairman of the Board. Both decrees provided that the British and
						French Governments should be unofficially consulted as to the nomination of
						Directors of those nationalities respectively.</p>
					<p>3 —Finally the Law of Liquidation of 17th July, 1880, assigned the receipts
						of this ad- ministration towards payment of ;he interest in the Privileged
						debt.</p>
					<p>Since 1877, when the Board was first con- stituted, the changes in the
						financial situation of the Government and the economic develop- ment of the
						country have naturally caused great changes in the conditions of working the
						Railways. From 1877 to 1885 the expen- diture was kept at an excessively low
						figure — between 33.5% and 42.8% of the gross receipts Maintenance was
						unavoidably sacrified to the necessity of meeting the interest on the Public
						Debt. The Convention of London in 1885 re- cognised the evils to which this
						was leading and provided that 45% of the Railway receipts should be
						sanctioned for expenditure on main- tenance and working. But even this
						propor- tion proved insufficient; and when the financial position of the
						country permitted it, the Decree of 21st May, 1902, allowed of the
						proportion being increased to 55%. The proportion actually sanctioned since
						that date has been 52% in each year.</p>
					<p>Notwithstanding there progressive increases, the system of sanctioning a
						fixed proportion has always proved troublesome, for it is almost impossible
						to spend to the best ad- vantage a sum which varies from year to year
						according to the state of the crops, the state of the market, and the
						condition of trade gene- rally. As, in addition to this, the expendi- ture
						on working and maintenance was for many yean excessivelyy low, the whole
						system was at one time in an alarming condition, while the supply of rolling
						stock was altogether insufficient.</p>
					<p>Special financial measures to deal with this state of affairs were absolutely
						necessary.</p>
					<p>To provide for exceptional expenditure, the law of liquidation provided that
						the general resources of the Egyptian Treasury should meet such expenditure
						as purchase of real pro- perty, construction and equipmentof new lines,
						repurchase of lines ceded to companies, doubling lines, construction of new
						buildings, banks, platforms, and the like. In practice, such expenditure has
						frequently been charged to revenue.</p>
					<p>The special credits granted for new works have been based rather on the
						Financial con- dition of the Treasury than on the commercial development of
						the country. The total expen diture on such credits has been :— From 1877 to
						1869........... Nil „ 1890 to 1898............. 9,089,237 „ 1899 to
						1904............. 1,883,397 Total............. 3,973.114</p>
					<p>The first of these three periods was a period of stagnation for the Railways:
						they were barely able to exist During the second period, the Railway system
						was being rapidly extended, lines were constructed by this Administration
						from Kafr Shaikh to Sherbin, from Damanhour to Rahmanieh, from Shibin el-Kom
						to Ash- moun, from Fayoum to Senouris, and from Assiout to Keneh: while the
						Government arranged for the construction of a line from Keneh to Assouan, of
						which the portion from Luxor to Assouan is of a narrow gauge, and handed it
						over to this Administration to work. Its cost is not included to the figures
						given above. During both these periods, the Per- manent Way, buildings, and
						accessories of the Railways suffered severely from want of expenditure on
						maintenance, while the rolling stock was overworked and insufficient for the
						traffic. During the third period, special credits were allotted chiefly to
						compensate for the insufficient revenue expenditure of the past by putting
						the line into good working order, and increasing the rolling stock. At the
						same time, the arrangements at the more important sta- tions were improved,
						and a system of signalling suited to the increased traffic was commenced.
						Finally, the line from Cairo (Embabeh) to Wasta was doubled. In addition, an
						arrange- ment was made with the Suez Canal Company to extend the standard
						gauge Railway to Port Said, thus giving a new outlet to the east of the
						Delta, and adapting the Railway system of Lower Egypt better to the
						requirements of the country. During this last period, the econ- omic
						position of the Railways was materially altered in one respect: up to the
						end of 1900 the Railways were in a favoured position com- pared to boat
						traffic : to protect their earnings navigation dues had been imposed which
						were almost prohibitive. On 1st January, 1901, in the interest of the
						country these dues were entirely suppressed. This measure, coming at a
						moment when the prosperity of Egypt was increasing rapidly, (scarcely
						affected the Rail- way receipts which continued to increase almost without
						intermission ; it was necessary however to adjust the tariffs to the new
						condi- tions created by water competition.</p>
					<p>Much yet remains to be done before the system can be in a satisfactory state,
						especially as regards the arrangements at the principal stations, the
						construction of some necessary extensions, the doubling of certain angle
						lines, and the increase in the quantity of rolling stock. The Government,
						having resolved to expand a sum of L-E 3,000,000 on such improvements,
						desired the advice of a Commission composed of well known British Railway
						authorities before sanctioning this large expenditure. The President of this
						commission was Lord Farrer, a director of the Midland and other Railway
						Companies; be was assisted by Mr. Oliver Burv, General Manager of the Great
						Northern Major le Breton, formerly of the Royal Artillery and of the Indian
						Railway Accounts Department. </p>
					<p>After spending a portion of November and December in the country, the
						Commission submitted a report which in most respects confirmed the opinion
						of the Board as to the necessity of the expenditure proposed. A part of the
						grant was at once placed at our disposal on which a programme of works is
						now being undertaken and a large quantity of rolling stock has been
						ordered.</p>

					<head>RUSSIA AND INDIA.</head>
					<p>Colonel Gaedke, formerly of the German Army, has just contributed to the
						"Berline Tegeblatt” two striking articles, entitled "Russia, and England in.
						Central Asia ” He was struck by the great number of English correspondents
						who were with both bellig- erents during the first year of warfare ; and
						though he saw therein a sign of the marvel- lously deep interest taken by
						Englishmen in the events of the war, yet he is led to ascribe the presence
						of so many English cor- respondents to a desire to ascertain the fighting
						value of the Russians with regard to possible complications in Central Asia.
						Co- lonel Gaedke a second article, dealing with "Russia in Turkestan,” is
						the more interest- ing from an English standpoint.</p>
					<p>In spite of its unsuccess in the Far East. Russia has worked sealonsly daring
						the last two years to improve its military position in Central Asia Of the
						greatest importance is the temporary construction of the Orenburg and
						Tashkend Railway, which "to my own know- ledge is to be built later as a
						double line, and then extended to Kelif, on the Amn-Darya, that is, close up
						to the Afghan frontier." Russia will then possess a second railway of
						greater carrying capacity than the present railway running from Krasnovodsk.
						on the Caspian Sea, to Merv and Kuschk, for the latter line could transport
						only the Caucasus troops to Turkestan, and tin new railway to Tashkend can
						carry troops in great numbers direct from European Russia. In Turkestan
						there are now two Army Corps, which, after deducting the troops quartered in
						the distant Semirechensk territory, comprise 2S ride battalions, 46 squad-
						rons of cavalry, 15 batteries with 114 guns and a respectable number of
						fortress troops. and military trains, which, as they are all kept on a war
						footing, represent a Russian vanguard always ready of about 32,000 men, who
						are supported by two reserve brigades of infantry, which on mobilisation can
						be developed into two divisions of infantry of 16 battalions. If the
						mobilisation takes three weeks, then at latest within five weeks after an
						outbreak of war 60 Russian battalions could take their stand on the Afghan
						frontier. But during the last eighteen months Russia has been at work very
						quietly in increasing these forces with a view to being able to place four
						Turkestan Army Corps in tho field, with at least two independent Cossack
						divisions. Thus there have been formed fifth companies to the 1st, 2nd, and
						3rd Rifle Brigades, two reserve batteries have been raised, and they can be
						enlarged to eight batteries in case of need troops of mounted infantry have
						been added to all battalions, artillery parks have been formed, together
						with four detachments of engineering parks Meanwhile further bat talions of
						titles are being raised ; thus, it looks as if the brigades of rifles, now
						numbering only four battalions, will be brought gradually up to the strength
						of four regiments, each of two battalions. Finally, siege corps have been
						formed, and the railway, telegraph, and for- tress troops have been
						increased.</p>
					<p>But, in view of the British strength, four Army Corps would not be sufficient
						for in- vading India ; other forces would have to be brought up from
						European Russia. For the first three weeks the two railways would be
						monopolised fully in transporting reserves, horses, food, and munitions of
						war, before fresh reinforcements could be transported by then. Experience
						has been gained of late by Russia in Siberia, and with an improved railway
						service each railway could convey an Army Corps in fourteen days ; allowing
						about eight days more than seven weeks after the begin rung of mobilisation
						Russia could have eight Army Corps, or about 260,000 soldiers, on the
						northern frontier of Afghanistan. If at the same time the British Army in
						the field num- bered nearly 200,000 men, then eight Russian Army Corps would
						certainly suffice for an attack on India only if Russia could be quite rare
						of the friendship of the Ameer of Afghan- istan, and that is improbable. The
						Ameer’s manifest interest lies in the maintenance of the present equilibrium
						between the two Great Powers, and it is clear that he has less to fear from
						England than he has from Russia, for the Russian conquest of India would put
						an end to his independence. There- fore, it is likely that the Ameer would
						oppose the entry of Russian troops into his country, and a Russian Army
						would suffer great losses in marching down through Afghanistan to its
						southern frontier, a distance of nearly 450 miles ; in any case at least
						150,000 men, and probably many more would be needed by Russia to guard its
						lines of communication, for even if the Afghans avoided an open battle, yet
						they would be bound to harass the the Russians all along their line. A
						guerrilla warfare would follow, and a Russian invading army of 250,000 men
						would require another army of 260,000 men, or even more, in its rear.
						Turkestan would need, together with reserve troops, 150,000 men. Thus, the
						forces would number about 650,000 men, which would have to feed 850,000 men.
						"</p>
					<p>But it may be supposed that each Russian Army at the front would not number
						more than 200,000 men in face of an English force as great, or even greater,
						seeing that Russia would have lost men in engagements and or the long march
						; therefore, any success or the part of an invading Russian Army is in no
						way to be looked for, and not even prob able. One will not form a wrong
						estimate in saying that at least one million Russian soldiers would have to
						be employed in con quering India. Again, before the Russian forces could
						reach the Indian frontier, Eng lish troops could be sent out from
						England.</p>
					<p>There must be always a powerful impedi ment in the way of a Russian advance
						on India, and that consists in the difficulties in- volved in feeding the
						invading force in the wild, hilly, thinly populated, poor country. which,
						with a superficial area rather larger than that of Germany, has a population
						of scarcely five million souls, and it would entail on Russia years of
						peaceful intercourse and an immense expenditure of money to pro- vide a
						suitable system of roads, so that the commissariat could be provided for
						properly. Colonel Gaedke suggests that by far the best thing for Russia to
						do would be to extend its Turkestan railway system southwards, either
						through Eastern Persia or even across Afghanistan. "But England has declared
						that it would regard such railway construc tion as being a hostile act and
						will reply to it be declaring war." Finally, Colonel Gaedke says that no
						sensible man can think it pos- sible for Russia to undertake the invasion of
						India, especially as, no matter how the present war may end, Russia will
						stand in need of a long period for collecting and re storing its shattered
						forces.</p>

					<head>NEW POST OFFICE, LONDON</head>
					<p>Arrangements are actively in progress for the laying of the foundation-stone
						of the new Post Office building by the King on Monday October 16. The plans
						and elevations are now complete, save in respect of a few minor details
						which are still under consideration. The struc- ture, with its yards and
						approaches, will oocupy 3 1/4 acres of the site recently vacated by the
						famous blue-coat school — Christ' Hospital—which has now located itself at
						West Horsham.</p>
					<p>Generally speaking, the new Post Office will replace the old east building at
						St Martin's-le Grand, which was designed by Smirk, com pleted in 1829, and
						now considered by the Post Office authorities to be unfit for their present
						work. The rooms are dark and incon- venient. Some of the walls, designed
						according to the ideas prevailing 80 years ago, are five and six feet in
						thickness, and the block of buildings, with the surrounding yard, covers a
						space of jest over two acres.</p>
					<p>A representative of the "Standard” had an interview with some of the chief
						officials at the Post Office a short while ago, and was informed that it is
						proposed to transfer all the depart- mental business now transacted at the
						St. Martin’s-le-Grand East premises to the new building. "It is not decided
						what shall be done with the old office," said one of these gentlemen, "but
						our work is growing at snob a terrific pace that there is little doubt a ass
						will be found for it It is not expected that it will be demolished, although
						elaborate alterations will be neccessary to render it suitable for modern
						requirements, whatever class of business it may be devoted to in the
						future.</p>
					<p>A month has now elapsed since the Post- master-General communicated with the
						Lord Chamberlain and the Speaker of the House of Commons as to the
						arrangements to be made for the admission of Peers and Common- ers to the
						ceremony of the laying of the foundation stone by the King. It is under-
						stood that replies have bean received as to the accommodation which will be
						needed by me members of the two branches of the Legislature. For these and
						the other numerous guests who will be invited to the ceremony elaborate
						seating arrangements are on foot The plans of the huge marquee which will
						occupy the centre of the site have been ap- proved and the work of erecting
						the stands has been commenced.</p>
					<p>The marquee will be of a horse-shoe form, and will contain ten blocks of
						solid wood- work, which, together, will be capable of accom- modating 1,900
						spectators. There will be in extensive covered approach to the marquee, in
						which nix blocks of stands will be cons- tructed, providing farther seats
						for some 2,000 visitors.</p>
					<p>The architect of the new office is Sir H. Tanner, who will, of course, carry
						out his duties under the supervision of the Office of Works. The clerk of
						the works trill be Mr. Leak. As yet, tenders for the building have not been
						accepted, or, if preliminaries have been arranged, contracts have not up to
						now been officially announced. It is an open secret that no particular style
						of architecture has been adopted, though it is understood that the new
						structure will preserve some of the leading characteristics of the old East
						building. The foundation work is in the hands of Messrs. Mowlem, and,
						roughly speaking, it is expected that the cost of the new offices, when com-
						plete, will amount to somewhere about a quarter of a million sterling.</p>

					<head>ENGLAND’S COTTON SHIPMENTS.</head>
					<p>The following interesting statistics relating to the shipment of yarn and

						The total shipments of yarn for the past eight months have been very large
						as compared with the corresponding period in the two pre- vious years. The
						following table speaks for itself :— Eight months ended August 31st Lbs.
						1905 ................. 132,114,200 1904 ......... 102,638,100 1903 .........
						101,916,300</p>
					<p>The increase in the takings abroad has been pretty general. It remains to be
						seen daring the remainder of the year and henceforward whether our foreign
						customers will continue to absorb more of our yam. Our shipments of cotton
						cloth in August were hardly np to what was expected, bat for the past eight
						months they are of enormous proportions, as will be seen from the following
						table :— Eight months ended August 31st Yards. 1905 ..................
						4,076,229,300 1904 .................. 3,599,155,800 1903....................
						8,588,814,800</p>
					<p>China is taking very largely this year, and she accounts for most of our
						total increase. Then Turkey and Egypt, as well as Japan, have been very
						busy. Few countries, indeed, excepting the Argentine Republic and Vene-
						zuela, have done badly. Altogether, our exports of piece goods continue
						large. It is noteworthy that whilst ire have a large increase in bleached
						doth, printed goods remain practi- cally stationary.</p>
					<p>The long record of success held by a very popular necessity is referred to in
						the article "Tried and Trusted," on page 5. This adds weight to the
						undoubtedly unanimous opinion of the public printed on so many occasions in

						Oriental pearl, The account concludes by stating that a marked feature of
						the Ceylon pearl fishery, under all administrations, has been its
						uncertainty, long intervals elapsing during which it has been unprofitable
						to fish the oysters. During the Dutch occupation there were several such
						periods, notably those be- tween 1732-1746 and 1768-1796. Later records show
						that under British rule several similar failures have occurred, the longest
						being from 1820 to 1828, from 1887 to 1854, and from 1864 to 1873. The
						intermittent character of the fishery has long been a matter of concern to
						the Government, and from time to time investigations have been made in the
						hope of placing the industry upon a more permanent basis, but up to the
						beginning of the present century few practical conclusions had been arrived
						at In 1902, however, Professor Herd- man, F.R.S, at the invitation of the
						Govern- ment, initiated a series of exhaustive investi- gations upon the
						nature and condition of the pearl banks, the life-history of the oyster, and
						the numerous biological problems which have proved to be so intimately
						connected with the distribution of the animal and the formation of the
						pearls themselves. As a result of the investigation it has been possible to
						pat for- ward many suggestions and recommendations, which, it is hoped, may
						prove of considerable value to the industry. Not the least important outcome
						of the inquiry is the establishment of a marine biological station at Galle
						in charge of a biologist, who will carry out the suggestions embodied in the
						report, and in- vestigate further problems, not only those in connection
						with the pearl industry, but also others concerned with the extension of
						existing small marina indus trios, such as the chank and trepang fisheries,
						and the establishment of possible new ones, e.g., a sponge fishery.</p>
					<p>The purely scientific part of the investigation has resulted in discoveries
						of great economic importance. It was showed that, in the great majority of
						oases, "Orient" pearls are formed by the deposition of nacre around the dead
						bodies of the spherical larvae of a small marine tape worm (Tetrarhynchus)
						which infects the Ceylon pearl oyster, and not, as is so generally supposed,
						around an intruding sand grain. In the case of the less valuable “seed"
						pearls, the irritant body is a small crystal found in certain muscles of the
						animal, and around which the nacre is similarly deposited. The life-history
						of the tape-worm causing the formation of Orient pearls was carefully worked
						out The parasite was traced from the oyster to certain species of fishes
						(Batistes), which prey upon shellfish, and theuce to the large fish-eating
						rays or sharks which, in their turn, feed upon the file fishes. In the rays
						the worm becomes mature, and sets free into the sea numerous embryos, which
						finally enter the body of the oyster and begin a new cycle of life-phases.
						The presence of the different hosts is, of course, essential for the
						completion of the life-history of the parasite, and as a result of the
						investigation it now becomes feasible to influence artificially the
						production of the filer pearls whenever the oyster can be cultivated in
						land-looked areas in which infected ray fishes can be kept alive in cage
						enclosures.</p>
					<p>The practical conclusions arrived at by Prof. Herdman may be briefly
						summarised as fol- lows :—(1) The Cheval and North and South Modragam Pairs,
						together with the Periya Paar Kerrai and the Muttavaratu Paar, still form
						valuable and trustworthy fishing grounds. Others, e-g., the Chilaw, Dutch
						Modragam, Alantura, and Karattva, are less trustworthy, but may prove
						valuable on occasions. (2) The Periya Paar and others cannot be relied upon
						to produce adult stock suitable for fishing, but might be used as sources of
						supply of young brood oysters. (3) A number of the smaller paars are
						practically useless from an economic point of view. (4) The most important
						agent in erasing widespread destruction of pearl oysters in the Gulf of
						Manaar is the covering of the paars with sand drifted by the strong currents
						and the south-west monsoon. Next in importance are the ravages of natural
						enemies, the chief of which are (a) voracious fishes, chiefly rays and file
						fishes;(b) boring mollusca, worms, and sponges ; (e) starfishes. With re-
						gard to the fishes mentioned under (a) it must be remembered that their
						presence is essential to the formation of pearls in the oyster», and
						that.the loss of a pertain number of the latter is a toll which should be
						willingly paid. (5) Overcrowding, disease, and overfishing may, on occasion,
						prove disastrous. (6) It is desirable and practicable that spat should be
						transplant- ed from unfavourable to favourable ground, and that overcrowded
						beds should be thinned out. (7) The banks should be carefully inspected and
						speedy fisheries undertaken at the right time.</p>

					<head>GERMANY AND THE MOROCCAN NEGOTIATIONS.</head>
					<div type="item">
						<head>“Times”</head>
						<p>The dilatory course of the negotiations which M. Revoil and Dr. Rosen are
							conduct- ing in Paris on the Morocco question is giving rise to feelings
							and to expressions which it is impossible to regard without a measure of
							uneasiness Nobody, we imagine, is more conscious of the fact, or of the
							very undesir- able consequences to which it may lead, than is the German
							envoy himself. Dr. Rosen's sincere desire to bring the important and
							honor- able mission with which be is entrusted to a successful
							termination can scarcely be doubted. He has knowledge and discernment
							enough to perceive that the result of his mission may have a great and
							an enduring effect upon the view which other nations besides France will
							take of the straightforwardness and of the German Government Success
							would tend to dispel the mistrust which the tortuous pro- ceedings of
							the Berlin Foreign Office have too generally inspired. Failure, on the
							other hand, would intensify and perpetuate all the old suspicions of
							German good faith............. The French have kept their temper with a
							judgment and a self control which do them infinite credit but it is not
							wise to calculate too confidently on their power to endure the strain
							indefinitely. Unless Germany has very serious ends in view, she is
							running an un- justifiable risk, and it is not easy to see what serious
							ends she can hope to attain by per- severance in her present
							attitude.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="item">
						<head>"Standard "</head>
						<p>What does Germany want ? Let her form- ulate her views, and an end be
							made of these wearisome and apparently futile parleyings. A very
							significant protest has appeared in a newspaper which is understood to
							receive official inspiration. France did not desire that a Colonial
							question should lead to complica- tions in Europe. On the other hand, it
							will not permit such a problem to bring humiliation on the nation. It
							was to a Conference that Germany made appeal, and France is ready to
							abide by the result. She is aware that when the meeting takes place she
							will certainly have Great Britain with her, and may probably reckon on
							the general co-operation of Spain. However that may be, she is clearly
							entitled to ask that Berlin shall at last lay its cards on the table. If
							the project of an international discussion is m longer pleasing to
							Germany, it is time that the project should be openly abandoned. The
							question of Morocco would then return to the position which it occupied
							before the Kaiser made his journey to Tangier.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="item">
						<head>"Globe.”</head>
						<p>The feeling is gaining ground that the Kaiser only raised the question in
							order to discuss politics in general, and the whole subject of the
							relations between the Republic and the Empire : in Morocco itself, it is
							ad- mitted that he has very little interest, or if he bad, that the
							course of European politics, and the attitude of other Powers, bas shown
							him that there is not much to hope for in that direction. By this time
							it is clear that what- ever may be the outcome of the negotiations,
							Germany will have gained nothing so far as her relations with France are
							concerned. The younger Gallic generation had lost much of the passionate
							hatred of their fathers for the enemy of thirty-five years ago ; some of
							the more generous spirits had even suggested burying. the hatchet and
							cultivating friend- ship with Germany. Bat all the old suspic- ion is
							now revived, and there can be no cordiality between the neighbours for
							many years to come.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="item">
						<head>"Eclair.”</head>
						<p>We deplore that the Franco-German negotia- tions à propos of Morocco
							should drag on so slowly that their conclusion,already announced as
							certain and final,should again be postponed, Bat the mistake was to
							suppose that they could be finished so quickly, as if the German
							Government was showing the same empresse ment and sincerity as the
							French Government Hero there is an earnest desire to come to terms, we
							do not say even at the cost of oar African interest but almost at any
							price. That this keen desire to withdraw from the international wasps’
							nest should be known by our adversary is a source of weakness, for he
							takes advantage of it, all the more as he himself is not disposed to
							hasten the end of the incident or even very anxious to close it at
							all.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="item">
						<head>The "Matin.”</head>
						<p>Contrary to what had been believed after Prance had agreed to take part
							in the Morocco Conference, an understanding with Germany is net easy.
							The demands of Germany have assumed every day greater proportions, while
							at the same time the requirements of Count von Tattenbacb, the German
							Minister at Fez became more imperious. Germany pretends to have
							considerable rights -almost as consid- erable as those of France. The
							latest development is that Wilhelm- strasse appears to have shown a
							gleam of <cb/>iretence to possess a port in Morocco on he
							Atlantic—Mogador, it is said. French diplomacy will not let itself be
							inveigled into discussing this proposal, which tends to assail the
							integrity of the Shereèfian empire for the benefit of a rival nation—the
							very nation which reproached France with trying to do the same thing for
							her own benefit Still, the negotiations will probably be re- sumed
							today. Nothing could tire the ex- trame patience or the perfect goodwill
							of France, and it is impossible for an under- standing not to be
							affected.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="item">
						<head>"Echo de Paris."</head>
						<p>The "Echo" draws attention to the fact that, unanimity being almost
							impossible, the prob- able result of the Conference will merely be the
							recognition of the independence of Morocco by Frence, England, and
							Spain. On the other hand Germany, haring assured the Sultan of his
							independence and integrity of territory, while delivering him from the
							special action of Prance with which he was menaced, will not hold in
							Morocco a preponderating place anal- ogous to that, which she bolds in
							Constan- tinople.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="item">
						<head>“Figaro.”</head>
						<p>Eugene Laurier says in the “Figaro" : — "If the whole of Morocco was not
							worth war, the quarter or the tenth part of Morocco, which we are
							disputing about now, is not better worth it. What is the good of
							bothering our- selves then t Can yon bring yourself to believe that you
							were not bald op to the moment when one snatched the last hair from your
							head ?”</p>
						<p>M. Laurier goes on to say that the discourag- ing thing about the present
							situation is that not a single one of the points in dispute need have
							existed if the agreement of July 8 had been respected in letter and
							spirit For the matters being discussed now—the Mole and the loan, and,
							perhaps, the question of policing the frontier—are clearly referable to
							the Con- ference, and two of them have improperly come into existence
							since the Conference was agreed upon.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="item">
						<head>"Patrie."</head>
						<p>The "Patrie” says that one of its represent- atives has had a short
							conversation with Dr. Rosen, who, in reply to a question whether Germany
							might not be using the Morocco business in order to obtain a
							modification of the eleventh Article of the Treaty of Frankfort, which
							confers on France the advantage of the most favoured nation, now
							regarded as a hin- drance to Germany's commercial convention, said, "Yon
							can contradict the assertion ; my mission does not go beyond
							Morocco.”</p>

					<div type="item">
						<head>SWEDEN AND NORWAY. "Telegraph" </head>
						<p>There is welcome news irom Karlstad. An official communication was issued
							on Saturday evening to the effect that there was “reason to hope that
							the Swedish-Norwegian negotia- tions will shortly lead to a definite
							result." A war between two countries which but yester- day were at least
							nominally one would have been too unnatural for civilised opinion to
							stand, especially as the question at issue was mainly one of what the
							French call amour pro- pre. But in all family differences the point of
							dignity assumes a more formidable character than in disputes between
							strangers. To out- siders it seemed as if the fortran difficulty was
							capable of being arranged on the most equit- able and honorable basis,
							especially as Nor- way has no more to fear from Sweden than Sweden from
							Norway. That either should at- tack the other after they had agreed to
							sepa- rate would have been inconceivable but for the relations in which
							they had previously stood. We do not yet know the exact terms on which
							the proposed arrangement is to be made, but it is sufficient to learn
							that an arrangement is in Sight.</p>

						<p>While everyone will experience a feeling of relief at the pacific outlook
							of the negotiations many people will wonder whether peace has not been
							too dearly bought, and whether it is a lasting one.</p>
						<p>In well-informed quarters it is believed that the negotiations will
							continue until the middle of next week, when a preliminary result may be
							expected. Id such circumstances do parti- culars will be published until

						<p>It is certain that some of the difficulties still remain to be overcome,
							and the news from various parts as to the mobilisation measures and the
							dispatch of troops in Norway do not speak in tones too peaceful or
							brotherly. Should it be Norway’s intention to couple her final
							diplomatic action with military measures, the Swedish Government must
							consider what steps are necessary to meet the warlike preparaitions of
							Norway.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="item">
						<head>“Stockholms Tidningen”</head>
						<p>Norway’s military array on the frontier cannot otherwise be explained
							than as the expression of a wish to try our patience to the utmost, and
							to humiliate us now and in history. If no treachery is concealed behind
							the peaceful declarations from Karlstad, the Norwegian mobilisation most
							be counter- manded very shortly. Should this not be <cb/>done, the

					<p>Every week for years past new and impor- tant cores by Dr. Williams' Pink
						Pills for Pale People have been published in these columns, yet they are few
						compared with the thousands of others received by the proprietors of these
						pills. The latest cure is that of Mr. Thomas Burling, of 7 Old Mill- The
						constant taking of sundry purgatives,” he said, "had weakened me beyond all
						reason, and I began to suffer from severe headaches, and pains in the sto-
						mach. Added to this, a bad attack of influ- enza so shattered my nerves that
						I had to give np an active life outdoors and take up work in an office. My
						health became worse ; the headaches were violent and frequent ; I went off
						food. My strength seemed broken, And I really contemplated giving up work
						altogether—I seemed such a physical wreck. Unable to work, and too ill to
						even rest, I endured an existence of pitiable misery.</p>
					<p>"The prospect was gloomy, when my mother pressed me to try Dr. Williams' Pink
						Pills. She had previously derived benefit from them. I was astounded at the
						relief obtained from the first few doses. My headaches vanished. I could eat
						with relish, and I began to feel as though new blood was coursing through my
						veins. Then I knew I had discovered a medi- cine that would cure me ; in
						fact, Dr. Wil- liams' Pink Pills did cure me, and speedily. T can walk long
						distances, though before it used to exhaust me going to and from the
						station. My cure is permanent, thanks to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills."</p>
					<p>New blood filled his veins as Mr. Burling took Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and
						this is how thousands of other men and women have also been oared by these
						pills in oases of Anaemia, Indigestion, Bile, Consumption, Eczema and Skin

						took from Great Britain goods to the value of (these are only approximate
						figures, but near enough for our purpose) £5.750.000; in 1903, £6,000,000;
						and in 1904, the value was over £7,000,000. These figures speak for
						themselves, and, at first sight, they appear to be a glowing tribute to the
						energy of British merchants and manu- facturers.</p>
					<p>But, while the exports of British goods to Egypt have been increasing in a
						fairly satis- factory manner, the exports of competitive nations to the same
						country have increased to an even greater extent. Let us take a single
						instance, Germany. In 1902, her exports to Egypt were valued at
						(approximately) £600,000 ; in 1903 they had increased to £760,000, whilst
						for 1904 the figures stand at considerably over a million sterling. Figures
						Site apt to be monotonous, and it is not my intention to trouble the reader
						with any more. Let it «office to say that the-value of the exports of
						several other nations into Egypt show equally the same signs of improvement
						as those I have given for Germany. They form e striking index of the
						commercial growth and importance of the market, and show that there is ample
						room for development even yet The British figures may appear satis fee tory
						for the period named, but they are not nearly so satisfactory as those of
						other nations, if we reckon out the money we have spent on its
						development</p>
					<p>I would strongly advise our manufacturers and merchants to watch the trend of
						affairs in Egypt Here we have a market which imports increasing quantities
						of goods annually, and which will probably continue to do so for many years
						to come. The commercial houses of other nations have been busily engaged for
						years past catering for the requirements of this na- tion, while, perhaps,
						the attention of our own manufacturers has been tamed too much towards Sooth
						Africa. It is gradually becoming recognised, however, that the possibilities
						of the latter market have been greatly over- estimate 1, and manufacturers
						who are now seeking for 00tie’s for their surplus goods will do well to tarn
						their attention to the Egyptian trade.</p>
					<p>Judged from British standpoints, it must be admitted that the business
						instincts of the Egyptian traders do not rank very high. Amongst almost all
						the houses we find a strong predilection for “claims,” and unless order* are
						executed in strict accordance with samples submitted or specifications sent,
						a claim will assuredly be put in. Bat then, foreigners the world over dearly
						love an ex- ouse for making a claim, and we must not judge the Egyptian
						traders too harshly for this little weakness. It is not an altogether
						amiable weakness, but it is by no means an uncommon one, and every
						manufacturer with aoy pretensions whatever to an expert trade, has doubtless
						at some time or other of his career felt its injustice. Claims will often be
						made on the slightest excuse, and the manufacturer most be prepared to
						submit to them, at least in part, or to have an agent on the spot to whom
						the goods can be transferred in ease of necessity. A resident agent, whether
						he be an Englishman or native, is an absolute necessity to the British
						manufacturer, and the growth in the number of them established in recent
						years amply testifies to their usefulness. No foreign firm aver places
						orders for goods merely for the fun of the thing. They see a possible outlet
						for them and they order accordingly. When the goods arrive they see, or
						think they see the possibil- ity of a claim being allowed and if the manu
						facturer has no reliable resident represent- ative to whom the goods can be
						banded over for re-distribution, he has to make the best arrangement he can
						with his customers. Obvi- ously it would not he wiaeto have tbegoods re-
						turned to England, thereby incurring double freight expenses, &amp;c., all
						to no purpose and only resulting in a dead lose. On the other hand, where
						there is a representative on the spot, the exporter can afford to be more
						independent The goods have have been made for the Egyp- tian market, and if
						one customer will not have them it is probable another will, espe- cially if
						there is a chance of getting them at a slight reduction, and in cases of
						this kind (unless the goods are really not wanted when <cb/>landed), it will
						be found that after a little argument, the customer will give way and take
						the goods at the original invoice price. It is only in cases where the
						customer thinks the exporter has no other outlet that Le remains
						obstinate.</p>
					<p>It is useless for any exporter to imagine that he can maintain a substantial
						turnover with the Egyptian market on a strictly prompt cash basis. A certain
						amount of trade is conducted on this basis, but it is very limited indeed.
						Long credits are given and expected. Bills of six, nine, and twelve months’
						duration are often not met even when they fall due; oftentimes it is two or
						three months afterwards before the cash is forthcoming. This it undoubtedly
						a very re- grettable feature of the market, and one that is rather apt to
						discourage the British trader ; but other nations are prepared to give times
						terms, and the British exporter must do likewise.</p>
					<p>Far be it from my intention to discourage British -manufacturers and
						merchants from cultivating the Egyptian market. My object is to induce them
						to foster it as much as possible, but, at the same time, it is a duty to
						draw the attention of the render to the difficult and dangerous phases as
						well as the more rosente sides. In the two preceding para- graphs I have
						dwelt on rather disagreeable pha- ses, but it must not be inferred therefrom
						that the whole of the Egyptian trade is of an unsatisfactory and risky
						nature The difficulties of the Egyptian market to which I have refer- red
						are common to most other foreign markets of the world, and with the
						assistance of a reliable representative, and a little care and tact on tip
						part of the exporter, much friction can generally be avoided. British goods
						are preferred in Egypt to the productions of other nations, but the question
						of price is one that is always militating against our goods. The rail from
						Egypt is for cheapness, and all samples and goods must necessarily be
						adapted to the tastes and needs of the consumer. Our enter- prising rivals
						on the Continent have realised long ago that cheap goods and long credits
						are the essential points of the Egyptian trade, and the yearly increasing
						value of their exports to that country shows that their methods meet with
						approval.</p>
					<p>Egypt is a market which we have every right to look upon as one of Britain’s
						own. We have fought for it as no other nations ever have ; we have spent
						enormous sums of money in its development, and many hundreds of our
						countrymen have laid down their lives on its burning sands. Yet now we find
						other nations stepping in and year by year increasing the volume of trade.
						It is not right At present Britain holds about one third of the trade ;
						doable that quantity should be ours, if not even more, and I believe that
						this could be done if only our manufacturers and merchants would realise
						more fully the growing impor- tance of the market, and cater accordingly for
						ha requirements.</p>

					<head>DELEGATION MUNICIPALE</head>
					<p>( Communication Officielle ) La Délégation Manicipale s’est réunie le 26
						Septembre 1905. à 5h. p.m. sous la présidence de M. Arab. A. Ralli.</p>
					<p>Présents : MM. Abdel Moneim bey Dalil, L Escoffier, E. Stross, Q. Zervadachi,
						membres, A. Wilner, secrétaire p.i.</p>
					<p>La Délégation, statuant sur une demande de mise en viabilité d’une me située
						an "bain Cléopâtre'’ près do Sidi Gaber, estime qu’elie ne saurait
						entreprendre la confection de cette route que si le propriétaire riverain
						consentait à en supporter la totalité de la dépense, cette route n’étant pas
						une route encore cédée à la ville. </p>
					<p>La Délégation regrette de ne pouvoir, pour le moment, accéder b une demande
						tendant k la mise en viabilité d’une rue située près dos remparts. </p>
					<p>La Délégation autorise une dépanse de L.B. 95 environ pour l’établissement
						d'uno canalisa tion dans la rue Korra, pour l’écoalement des eaux ménagères,
						les frais de raccordement de cette canalisation aux maisons riveraines
						devant étre supportés par les propriétaires.</p>
					<p>La Delégation se préoccupe des inconvénients résultant de l’onverture de
						tranchees faites a tout moment sur les chaussées et trottoirs des voies
						publiques, ces tranchées étant assez sou vent exécutées immédiatement après
						la con- fection de travaux de voirie, tels que pavage, macadamisage ou
						asphaltage de routes.</p>
					<p>Los réparations effectuées b la suite de ces tranchées, malgre tous les soins
						qu’on pourrait y apporter, ne pourraient jamais remettre les routes dans
						leur état premier.</p>
					<p>Aussi, le Collège estime qu’il importerait, soit d’obliger les propriétaires
						b exécuter lés travaux (^installation do canalisation d’eau, gaz ou autres,
						a l’occasion de la confection des tra- vaux de voirie, et préalablement a
						cette confec- tion, afin d'éviter l'éventrement ultérieur de dites routes,
						soit do mettra a leur charge une imposition, a titre de dédommagement, pour
						les dégâts causés par eux un pareilles circons tances.</p>
					<p>La Délégation met cette question a l’étude et chargeles Services de lui faire
						rapport an r lea maures qu'il y aurait lien de prendra poor l'application de
						ces dispositions. La séance est levée b 6 h. p.m.</p>

					<p>Si l’on en excepte le Rapport annuel des Directeurs de la Sait and SodaCy.LL
						présenté aux actionnaires b l'Assemblée Générale do 1 Join 1904, tenue b
						Londres, et le bilan arrêté au 31 Mars 1904, dont il a été donné connais
						sance par une brochure publiée a cet effet, aucune autre publication do
						bilan ni anonn rapport des Directeurs, ne sont venus exposer la situation de
						la Société, ni les nouvelles opé- rations faites, comme, par exemple,
						l’augmenta- tion du Capital et la fusion avec la Société des Huileries et
						Savonnerie d’Egypte, eto.</p>
					<p>Cependant le texte des statuts de la Société est formel a ce sujet:</p>
					<p>"Article 139.—A l’assemblée ordinaire de chaque année, excepté 1899, les
						Directeurs pré- senteront le compte des Profits et Pertes, une feuille de
						situation et an rapport sommaire des engagements, opérations, conclus on b
						con- clure, et ce 4 mois avant l’assemblée.</p>
					<p>"Article 61. — Des assemblées Générales auront lien an moins une fois par an,
						b l’en- droit qui sera désigné par la Compagnie, etc. "Article 142.—Au moins
						une fois par an, excepté 1899, la tenue des comptes de la Compagnie sera
						examinée, et l’exactitude des comptes Profits et Pertes et de la feuille de
						situation, constatée par un on plusieurs cen- seurs.”</p>
					<p>De ces trois articles, sans qu’il y ait besoln d’en continuer l’énumération,
						il résulte que la Société ne tiendra pas d’Assemblée Générale en 1905 du
						moment que les comptes n’ont pa été présentés jusqu’a présent (soit 4 mois
						avant l'assemblés)</p>
					<p>Bien que tons les actionnaires de la Sait &amp; Soda aient applaudi b la
						nomination dé la nou- velle Direction, dont l’honorabilité, la compé tance
						et le bavoir faire ne font aucun doute ; il n’en ont pas moins lien d’être
						surpris que de pais le 31 Mars 1904, sucun bilan n’ait été public, ce qui
						n’est sans doute pu de nature b faire taire les critiques pins on moins
						vrai- semblables que d’aucuns font entendre dans certains milieux.</p>
					<p>Nous sommes persuadés que la Direction de la Société reconnaissant la
						nécessité d’expli- pliquer les motifs du retard anquel il est fait allusion
						pins haut, ne manquera pas de couper court b tonte rumeur spéculative, par
						une déclaration claire et nette qui raffermira dans l’esprit du public

					<head>AUX SUCRERIES.</head>
					<p>La Société prétend que les prix de revient du sucre tels que je les ai
						exposés il y a quelque* jours sont erronés. Elle se garde bien de dire,
						comme elle le devrait en pareil cas pont détruire mon argumentation, quels
						sont les prix de revient exacts. Mais comment le ferait elle, alorsqu’elle
						n'en Bait rien elle-même et que ses comptables et directeurs sont dans
						l’impossibilité de répondre aux demandes qui leur sont posées a ce sujet
						Aussi, b la néga tion sans preuve des sncrerios, je réponds pat une
						confirmation pare et simple des renseigne mente qae j’ai donné»,
						renseignements que j’ai d’ailleurs puisés b la meilleure source.</p>
					<p>Si la direction professe l’ignorance la pins complète de sa gestion,
						o’est-b-dire du prix de revient de ses produits, elle croit pouvoir se
						rattraper sur le prix du sucre, coté sur le marché et qui u’est ignoré de
						personne !</p>
					<p>Mais la encore elle montre son pen de dis cernement. En fixant le cours de 25
						francs les 100 kilos, elle a cru que je parlais du prix du snore raffiné,
						alors que mon article traitait uniquement des usines sucrières d'Abou
						Ghourghas et de Nag Hamadi dont je mettais le prix de revient en lace da
						prix de vente pour montrer que la société fabriquait b perte. 11 n’y avait
						pas an mot concernant la Raffinerie de Hawamdieh on le sacre raffiné. C’est
						pour- tant lb qu’a cru pouvoir ce raccrocher la direc- tion pour déclarer
						naïvement que le cours de 25 francs était fantaisiste et s’entendait du
						sacre No 3 non raffiné, tandis que le snore raffiné coûtait beaucoup pins
						cher, soit P.T. 78 le cantar en pains et P.T. 63 le granulé !</p>
					<p>Que discute ces prix de raffiné et de granulé La question n’est pas ib. J'ai
						dit et je répète que le prix du ancre étant do 25 francs, les usines des
						sucreries fabriquent a perte, puisque leur prix de revient est supériear. Le
						cours de 25 francs les iOO kilos est actuellement le cours normal du ancre
						en gros et cala est si vrai que M. Caillaux, ex ministre des Finances, le
						prend ponr base dans an article sur la spéculation, publié dans le "Matin.”
						Les directeurs ne voudront pas soutenir, je pense, que tout ce qni sort des
						sucreries d'Egypte vaut du raffiné avant d'avoir passé par la
						Raffinerie.</p>
					<p>J’ajouterai an seal mot, c'est qu'on ne doit pas s'en prendre aux chefs
						d'usines ni b leurs subalternes de cet état anormal. Certains d’entre eux
						font preuve d’une réelle capacité et d one intégrité d’autant plus
						recommandable qu’elle se manifeste an milieu du gachis actuel. M. Naus,
						entre autres, mérite la reconnais- sance des actionnaires pour son récent
						acte de vigueur: Les vrais coupables, ceux qui doivent être tenus
						responsables de tout le mal, se trou- vent an sein du conseil
						d'administration. Le malheur d’une foule d'actionnaires, dont quel- ques-uns
						se trouvent absolument rainés par leur faute, doit dicter que conduite
						sévère, tant b la prochaine assemblée générale des actionnaires et an comité
						de dé tense de lean intérêts qu'aux juges éventuellement appelés b se

					<head>OUR PARIS LETTER. </head>
					<byline>(From Our Correspondent)</byline>
					<p>Paris, September 21. I have noticed lately that Englishmen on the Continent
						have been complaining very bitterly of the way in which, when they have had
						a grievance against an hotel—or thought they bad—the manager or proprietor
						has put them off with promises of investigation until the last moment, and
						then, after he has got all he could out of then, when they have been obliged
						to pay their bills and move on, be has repudiated all liability and said he
						could do nothing, that he was not responsible, eta No later than; yesterday
						I was informed of the case of a man who- is living at an hotel in Paris, and
						who has been robbed of £200. He had only taken 4 room at the hotel a few
						minutes before, and left it to go downstairs. When he returned he found that
						someone had made free with his baggage in his absence, and that he was £200
						the poorer. When the manager was appealed to, he said he could do nothing.
						So the Englishman went to the neighbouring police station and informed the
						commissaire of what had happened to him. He was also sensible enough to oil
						the wheels of justice with the promise of £20 if his money were forthcoming,
						and as there is no more powerful stimulus in this country—or in any
						other—than the prospect of "un petit cadeau,” it may be hoped that he will
						recover his bank- notes.</p>
					<p>On other occasions I have known managers, when a complaint was made to them
						that somebody’s baggage had been rifled, assure the customer- that an
						inquiry would be made, that it was quite unnecessary to worry, and that it
						would be all right in the end. What the manager probably meant was that it
						would be all right for him. Aa for the trav- eller—- well, he could not stay
						at the hotel for ever, and if he (the manager) could manage to prevent him
						curtailing his stay, the recovery of his missing money or jewelry was, after
						all, the visitor's affair. And so he was kept going with daily assurances
						that all that could be done was being done, but that up to present the
						police had no due. In similar cues, if I had to act myself, 1 think I should
						give the hotel manager twenty four hours to find the missing property or
						accept responsibility. It he failed to give me satisfaction, I should then
						give him to understand that if in another twenty-four hours I was unable to
						obtain a satisfactory reply from him I should at once place the matter in
						the hands of the police, and inform all my fellow-guests. As a final meuaoe
						I should add that by the next poet I was writing to the ' Times" a detailed
						account of the circumstances under which I had been robbed. No hotel manager
						likes it to be known that he harbours thieves, even if it be un- awares, and
						in all probability if you make it unpleasant enough for him be will
						understand that if he cannot place his hands on the stolen goods and that
						would in most oases be im- possible—he can offer you some compensation But
						you must not let the matter drag : act promptly and energetically.</p>
					<p>In the most hotels there is a notice to the effect that the hotel is not
						responsible for valuables which have not been confided to tbs keeping of the
						hotel safe. And it is only foil that those who travel with a lot of jewelry
						should comply with the request to let the hotel accept responsibility in
						this way. For the guidance of foreigners visiting France I may mention that
						in rival actions the “juge de paix” is competent in all purely personal
						oases and in suite regarding personal property np to the value of £12
						without appeal, and with right of appeal op to £24 deride without appeal up
						to £12, and with right of appeal it cases in which Courts of First Instance
						are competent without appeal, on disputes (1 Between hotel, inn. and
						lodging-housekeepers and travel!or* and lodgers for hotel charges and loss
						or damage of effects deposited in inns or hotels; (2) Between travellers and
						contractors for carriage by land or sea, for delays, travelling expenses,
						and loss or damage of effects carried with travellers ; (8) Concern- ing
						correspondence and registered objects and the carriage of paper and objects,
						the value of which has been declared, whether charged or not with repayment
						Iu this case the applica- tion may be made either to the “juge de paix" of
						the locality in which the sender lives, or to the “jugs de paix” of the
						locality inhabited by the person to whom the object is sent, at the option
						of the complainant The “juge de paix” also derides, without appeal, up to
						the amount of £19, and with the right of appeal to the extent of the demand,
						in disputes concerning (a) payment of rent, (b) notice to quit, (o) demands
						for cancelling leaves based on failure to pay rent or the insufficiency of
						furniture, or the destruction of the house or land leased, and (d)
						expulsions.</p>
					<p>Francis Bertie, the British Ambassador is, has just bean having some very
						fine at Hardelot, a picturesque locality the neighborhood of
						Boulogne-sur-Mer this charming district is little knot Englishmen, one can
						hardly expect it remain for long undiscovered. In fact, it was discovered
						long ago by an Englishman who was not indifferent to the charms of Nature in
						her pleasant moods—Charier Dickens. He happen ed on it by accident when he
						was on a visit to Boulogne, and it so fascinated him that took up his
						residence there for a rime, and, understand,wrote the greater part of the
						"Tale of Two Cities” while staying at Hardelot. I have seen the boose in
						whioh he wrote, and I can well understand that for a man who loved to get
						away from the city for a while, who liked <cb/>fresh air and a salt-laden
						breeze, wide spaces and changing, unspoiled surroundings, this was just the
						place. and Charles Dickens knew it. Another Englishhman, Sir John Hare, made
						his residence here some years ago, and rented Hardelot Castle. It is a
						splendid old fortress, and was evidently meant for business. The castle
						walls are over 1,000 feet in circumference, they are several feet thick, and
						there are four or five towers still standing, under which are the dungeons
						or ‘‘oubliettes’’ In one of them a skeleton, chained to the wall, was found
						by Sir John Hare during some excavations he carried out In the old days the
						road which leads to Hardelot Castle took you through an ancient portoullis
						and gateway, and across the moat, where the old drawbridge once existed.
						Altogether, it is a peculiarly interesting dis- trict, rendered all the more
						attractive to Englishmen through its associations with Dick- ens, and an
						ideal resort because of the fact that it is charmingly situated and has the
						finest sandy beach I ever looked upon.</p>
					<p>The patrimony of the city of Paris,or rather those responsible for its
						government, no doubt contributed very largely to the accident which caused
						M. Juttet’s death last Wednesday. Owing to the late hour at which the street
						lamps are lit, it was quite dark in the Champs Elysees when the accident
						happened, and it is possible that neither cabman nor chauffeur could see
						well enough to judge distances pro- perly. Of course, if that was so, all
						the more blame attaches to the chauffeur for driving fast But the
						municipality cannot shelter itself be- hind his fault There is no economy in
						leaving a great city in darkness an hour after sunset, and more than an hour
						before dawn. Besides in creasing the ordinary dangers of the streets, the
						practice enables the criminal class, so numerous and desperate in Paris, to
						prey with greater case on the community. Then some of the main arteries are
						very inadequately light- ed - the Champs Elysees especially, the lamps
						standing among trees which absorb the greater part of their light Failing
						any one of whom to inquire the road, a stranger would be compelled to climb
						the signposts and strike a match to read the names of the streets.</p>
					<p>The city has no excuse for being mean where the Champs Elysees are concerned,
						if one takes into account only the revenue brought in by the hiring of
						chairs. The privilege of letting out chairs in the streets of Paris during
						next year has recently been sold for £3.600, a sum which would have been
						much smaller if the Champs Elysees were not included. An industrious
						statistician has worked out that the holder of the chair monopoly must have
						820,000 cus- tomers at a penny each to get his money back, but the
						increasing keenness of competition for the privilege shows that the bargain
						is not a bad one. Add two millions more customers to pay the working
						expenses and provide a profit, and one gets a good idea of the number of
						people in Paris who can afford to take life easily.</p>
					<p>The agitation which lately led to a meeting of indignation on the part of the
						Paris postal employes has been followed by meetings all over the country,
						and the Postmaster-General seems to be in a fair way of losing his mind or
						his portfolio. Recently he was the recipient of a collective complaint from
						the French journal ists, whose telegrams concerning the grand military
						maneuvers in the east of France, dis- patched at seven o’clock in the
						evening,' did not reach their journals in Paris until after midnight. The
						Minister could give no adequate explanation of this discreditable delay, and
						as the newspapers are the last thing a politician wants to fall out
						with—they can make it so hot for him —we may expect to find some sort of
						reform introduced is the Post Office before long. After the sorters, the
						telegraph clerks, and the telephone girls, it is now the tarn of the humble
						postman to air his grievances, and at a meeting at the Labour Exchange in
						Paris a few nights ago, when some 2,000 letter- carriers were present, they
						protested very ener- getically against the conditions under which they are
						employed by the State. One of the main grievances is the insufficient
						remunera- tion they receive. In Paris—where they are paid better than
						anywhere else—a postman commences with £44 a year, and in the pro- oses of
						time mounts slowly to £80. But he cannot hope to get beyond that sum. As
						Paris is a costly place to live in, it can well be imagin- ed that if a
						postman is married and has two or three children he and his family are not
						often afflicted with goat. It was also complain- ed that the wages of
						auxiliary postmen in the country never exceeded £20 per annum ; but how a
						man can keep himself, let alone anyone else, on such a wage passes my
						comprehension. Before the meeting broke op several resolutions were passed,
						which are to be forwarded to the Postmaster-General and to the Minister of
						Commerce. May their fate be different from the usual fate of resolutions
						forwarded to similar destinations !</p>

					<p>Captain John Evans, 2nd Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, who
						discharged the duties of adjutant since the lamentable drown ing of Captain
						E. S. Carey at Ramleh, has been formally appointed to the poet Captain
						Evans, who joined the 2nd Battalion a few months ago from the Depot at
						Omagh, was with the 1st Battalion in the Boat war, and at Pieters’ Hill
						received no fewer than twenty-six wounds—a record. He afterwards went
						through the closing phases of the war with his present battalion.</p>
					<p>Major R Feetham, and Second Lieutenant A. G. Sharpe, 2nd Battalion Royal
						Berkshire Regiment, have been placed on duty with the Ira ft which the 1st
						Battalion will dispatch on the same date to the 2nd Battalion.</p>
					<p>Captain R. H. Collins, DAO., and Lieuten- ant C. W. Hemp, Royal Berkshire
						Regiment, who are rejoining the 2nd Battalion at Alex- andria, have been
						placed on duty with the draft of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, while the
						1st Battalion at Londonderry has prepared to join the 2nd Battalion at
						Cairo. The draft will leave Southampton on the 27th inst</p>
					<p>Lieutenant L. R Coke, a smart young sub- altern of the 1st Battalion Irish
						Guards, has been selected for service with the Khedive’s Army, and joins at
						once at Cairo for potting. Lieutenant Coke received his first commission in
						the Irish Guards in April, 1900, from the 3rd Battalion Notts and Derby
						Regiment, on the formation of the Regiment to mark the valour of her
						Majesty’s Irish soldiers in the late war in Sooth Africa.</p>
					<p>Lieutenant C. E. G. Woolcombe-Adams, R.H.A.. who has just gone to Egypt from
						the Irish command, had a fair share of active service experience in the Boer
						war. He was with the 4th Divisional Ammunition Column in Natal, and took
						part in the relief of Lady- smith, the action of Laing's Neck, and the
						operations east of Pretoria, including the actions of Lydenberg and
						Belfast.</p>
					<p>Lietutonant A. E. Bonham-Carter, 1st Bat- talion King’s Royal Rifle Corps,
						Cairo, has had to go on temporary half pay, owing to ill health. His health
						was indifferent since the South African campaign, when he contracted fever,
						if I remember correctly, whilst cam- paigning east of Pretoria.</p>
					<p>Second Lieutenant G. N. Hubbard, 1st Battalion Rifle Brigade, Malta, has
						resigned his commission after holding it three and a half years.</p>
					<p>The battleship Dominion, Captain J. L Marx, having satisfactorily gone
						through her full power trials, joins the Atlantic Fleet on her maiden
						commission.</p>
					<p>The Illustrious, which lately returned home from the Mediterranean Station,
						where she spent nearly eight years, is to undergo an extensive refit at
						Chatham. The outlay will amount to dose on £79,000.</p>
					<p>The frigate Aotaeon (late Ariadne), Capt. R. Hudleston, was passed out of the
						dockyard hands at Sheernees on Saturday on the com- pletion of extensive
						alterations and repairs to fit her for duties as a torpedo-school ship in
						connection with the torpedo school which is to be established at Sheernes
						for the training of ratings from the Medway Depot, who have hitherto had to
						go to Portsmouth or Devon - port to undergo the torpedo instruction, About
						£17,000 has been expended on the Aotseon in preparing her for service, and
						she has been taken from the dockyard moorings to a berth at the entrance to
						Stan gate Creek, opposite to Pott Victoria, where torpedo instructional work
						will be carried out.</p>
