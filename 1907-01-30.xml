                    <head>THE PREVENTION OF PLAGUE</head>
                    <p>In offering a prize of 10,000 francs for the best method of killing flies,
                        the French journal "Le Matin" has indirectly given a great impetus in India
                        to the crusade against palgue. The prize awarded by "Le Matin"</p>
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    <p>was gained by the advocate of "L'Huile de Schiste" a by-product from shale. A
                        cutting form the paper was sent by Mr. R.D. Tate to Mr. Fraser, on of the
                        staff of the "Times of India," whence it reached Dr. Turner, the exectuie
                        health officer of Bombay. Recent eleborate experimental research as embodied
                        in the report of the Plague Commission in India had insiputably proved that
                        the flea was the cheif, if not the only, means of transferring the germs of
                        plague from rats to man and from rat to rat.</p>
                    <p>Immediately this was clearly recognised, the natural corollary was to find
                        means of getting rid of either of the rats or the fleas, or both. Whils the
                        crusade against rats was pressed with renewed vigour, the investigations
                        were carried out as to the most effective means of destroying fleas. It was
                        easily show that corrosive sublimate and the usual disinfectants employed by
                        the Indian sanitary services had little effect on fleas except, if anything,
                        to make them more lively. On the first experiments that all that was claimed
                        by the French investigator for l'huile de schiste as a destroyed of flies
                        was equally true when the substance was applied to fleas. On the plague
                        germs in artificial cultivation in the laboratory it was shown to have
                        little effect. But on actually spreading the material on the floors and
                        walls of plague-inflected rooms, it was found speedily to rid them of the
                        fleas, the harbourers of the plague germs.</p>
                    <p>Elaborate experiments were crried out by Dr. Turner and Major Lamb, I.M.S.,
                        of the Plague Research Committee, which fully confirmed them in the former's
                        belief that this residuary product of petroleum is not only the easiest and
                        most efficacious agent for destroying rat-fleas but at the same time the
                        only effective known remedy. So convincing was the evidence that with
                        commendable promptitude the Bombay Municipality lost no time in commencing
                        operations with it on a larger scale. Fifty tons of the crude material left
                        after the distillation of petroleum, to which the appropriate name of
                        "pesterine" was given, were obtained, and the disinfection of 2,500 of the
                        worst plague-infected rooms was carried out. In a recent report of Dr.
                        Turner, Execturive Health Officer of the Bombay Municipality, incontestible
                        evidence was given that the use of this product from petroleum was, if not
                        the direct solution of the question of how to deal most effectively with
                        plague, certainly the best means of killing the carries of plague. The
                        method of disinfecting a room is to sprinkle a little "pesterine" on the
                        floow, the remove the furniture, and with a long brush, spread "pesterine"
                        over the ceiling, then swab the walls, and finally with a broom brush the
                        thick fluid all over the floors. The substance is not readily inflammable,
                        and its use does not damage the interior of houses.</p>
                    <p>Although at present the substance, practically hiterto a waste product, is
                        infinely cheaper than other disinfectats-- almost absurdly so, as for a few
                        pence a whole house can be disinfected-- it is probale that the demand in
                        the future will enhance its value. Thus it has been noticed that the
                        spreading of this materaial on earthen floors makes a surface in many was
                        similar to asphaltem and already is suggested to use it as a possible
                        solution to the great dust problem aggravated by the introduction of motors. </p>
                    <p>Fortunately plague now-a-days never makes much headway in Egpyt, although the
                        means of combating it entrails considerable cost to the sanitary services.
                        Its recurrence from time to time, however, more especially in the three
                        chief ports, necessitating some inconvience to and a heavy tax on, commerce,
                        suggests, that the wholesale treatment block by block, of at least all
                        cellar bordering on our wharves, as well as all houses known to have been
                        infected at any time during the present decade, on the lines carried out in
                        Bombay, might perhaps be the most effectual barrier of quarentine that could
                        be imposed. All other precautionsand regulaitons seem long ago to have
                        forfeited the confidence of the public, who are seldom scrupulous in evading
                        suhc restrictions. A wholesale crusade against rats and fleas would show
                        that our authorites were alive to the importance of checking, and if
                        possible, exterminating the evil. It would be too much to expect cooperation
                        from the people, either European or native, as people are notoriously
                        apathetic on all such subjects unless they are aroused by an immediate
                        danger to their own existence or wellbeing.</p>

                        <head>Burning a Bowab.</head>
                        <p>The police authorities at Alexandria have closed the enquiry in the case
                            of Mr. Alexander Masoha, the Greek who is accused of having set fire to
                            his bowab while asleep. The Greek's defence is that be is so
                            short-sighted he is almost blind. He lives in the building where the
                            bowab is employed. About twenty days ago the bowab and a number of his
                            friends were making a great noise and the man called down from his house
                            and told the bowab to keep quiet. If not he threatened that he would
                            burn him. He never intended to carry out his threat. Lately, on account
                            of the cold weather the bowab made a fire and owing to sitting too close
                            to it his garments caught alight and he was burnt to death. The
                            accusation that the Greek was a party to the bowab's death is now said
                            only to rest on the idle threat which he did not mean to execute, and it
                            was by a pure coincidence that the man happened to be burnt to death
                            some days afterwards owing to his own fault. The bowab, who disliked the
                            Greek, before be died declared that his death was due to the latter. The
                            bowab’s sister, bowever, now contradicts her brother's dying statement.
                            An enquiry is still contiouing at the Hellenic Consolate.</p>

                        <p>A very original form of entertainment for Cairo was that given at the Y.
                            W. C. A. rooms at Connaught House on Tuesday afternoon, when the
                            representative of the H. J Heinz Company gave a practical demonstration
                            of the many and varied products of this enterprising company. The lady
                            lecturer, Miss McLeod, has already paid extensive visits to many
                            countries, spreading the name and reputation of her employers in foreign
                            lands. Her travels have led her to India, the Straits Settlement”, Siam,
                            the Philippine Islands, S. Africa, Australia and other places, where she
                            has met with most kind reception and en-couragment. While in Siam she
                            had the honour of preparing and serving a dinner to the King ; and sixty
                            of his suite ; and while in Australia her demonstrations and popular
                            lectures were attended by many of the wives of the high officials. The
                            entertainment on Tuesday partook more of the nature of a friendly “At I
                            Home" than a leature, and a varied menu, consisting of stuffed olives, a
                            very special brand of tomato soup, baked beans, mince meat, apple butter
                            crackers. cherry ice, and other dainties were offered to the guests who
                            filled the room. Silver chafing dishes steaming on the table were need
                            in the preparation of these delicacies ; and Miss McLeod was kept hard
                            at work explaining the manufacture of these valuable foodstuffs and the
                            manner in which to serve them to best advantage. An interesting little
                            pamphlet entitled "The Spice of Life" was also handed around to the
                            assembled guests, the perusal of which will certainly convince most that

                        great name for himself as a painter of Egyptian landscapes, has returned
                        from Luxor and reopened his exhibition at the National Hotel. The water
                        colours which he has brought back with him from Upper Egypt excel any which
                        he has hitherto exhibited, and we are convinced that it is no exaggeration
                        to assert that for delicacy and richness of colouring, with which is
                        combined an unnsual accuracy in the drawing, the best of his latest efforts
                        are unsurpassable. The succes of his exhibition amply proves tbe
                        appreciation of his former clinets, and at the same time his clinetele is
                        increasing daily. Yesterday after-noon, among the distinguished visitors who
                        inspected Mr. Lamploogh's exhibition, were Prince Mohamed Aly and Prince
                        Ibrahim Halim. Both expressed their admiration of Mr. Lamploogh's skill in
                        the faithful portrayal of Egyptinn landscapes, and Prince Mohamed Aly has
                        purchased perhaps the best of his latest paintings, a beautiful evening
                        river scene at Luxor, in which tha various colours of this country's
                        enchanting afterglow are reproduced with most perfect truthfulness. Prince
                        Ibrahim Halim bought the picture “The Pyramids from above Cairo," which we
                        have commented opon before, in which the mist effect is brought out

                            steamer and then a decision will be arrived at as to what line of policy
                            should be followed in regard to obtaining compensation</p>

                        <p>NATIVE PRESS AND THE "AFFAIR."</p>
                        <p>Our opinion of the common-sense of certein of tge leaders of the
                            “Nationalist" party was never very high, but we are amazed to find “Al
                            Moayad” in the same galley as Mustapha Pasha Kamel—unless our excel-
                            lent confrere has been chained to the bench by the Editor of “Al Lewa.”
                            “Al Moayad’s" article on the “Russian affair” it worthy of the ingenious
                            tribune : there it the same extraordinary bias, the same urious
                            illogicality. In fact, so deeply does the author deplore the fact that
                            Lord Cromer's views on the Capitulations have been justified by events
                            that he can hardly refrain from insunuationsi that tne Alexandria
                            manifestations were, what is vulgarly termed, “a put-op job," e g.,
                            firstly, what of the genuine or feigned incapability of the Alexandria
                            police to prevent the outrage on the Russian Consulate and the insult to
                            the Imperial escutcheon when the Cairo police, were able to guard the
                            Russian Vice Consulate from attack and in-sult." Again we read, à propos
                            of Lord Cromer's reply to M.M. Chalom and Rossi : “Thus Lord Cromer has
                            allowed a crying injustice to be committed to enable him to argue in
                            favour of his personal opinions on the Capitulations."</p>
                        <p>We should like to point out that our contemporary has completely barked
                            the real question at issue, viz., “Were the Egyptian Government and the
                            representative in Cairo of the British Occupation justified in refus-
                            ing to commit a violation of international law on behalf of three felons
                            ?" Of the Russians, two coofessed their participation in a plot to blow
                            up a steamer on which some few Egyptians would probably have been
                            passengers. We fail to see how such an act would benefit humanity,
                            liberty in Russia, or any cause but that of autocracy. So the less about
                            “crying injustice" the better. Does “Al Moaysd” really wish Egypt to be
                            the base of operations for European Anarchists. Nihilists, and others?
                            Strange forms of patriotism have at times been professed by Egyptians,
                            btt this is the strangest.</p>
                        <p>Again, if the police at Alexandria failed to disperse the crowd, was not
                            that due to the numbers of the assailants and the vigour of - their
                            tactics. At Cairo they had the warning from Alexandria. “But none are so
                            deaf,” etc. 'Al Moayad" endows Lord Cromer with designs for the
                            extinction of Egyptian liberties, and when our representative proposes
                            modifications in the régime which has long fettered, and we fear may
                            long fetter BEgypt, our con- temporary hints at Macchiavelli.</p>
                        <p>So much for an article wherein insinuation usurps the place of thought.
                            What our Nationalists have always lacked is constructive criticism. We
                            have heard of many Egyptian Parliaments, but never of the details of
                            their organisation. We have heard numerous critiques of the educational
                            system but never seen an alternative scheme proposed by Egyptians. And
                            now our good contemporary is very angry at the 'crying injustice" that
                            has been com- mitted. but cannot give the Government any reasonable
                            advioe as to how react next time three individuals try to make Egypt
                            their base of operations against a friendly Power.</p>

                    <p>"RIGOLETTO."</p>
                    <p>"Rigoletto"—that “somewhat faded music,” as a London critic once called
                        it—was duller than ever last night. The compaoy seemed to lose all interest
                        in it—small blame to them. Signor Battani did let himself go to some extent
                        in “La donna e mobile,” and of course was encored. His voice is, if
                        anything, more charming than ever. Signor Vecchioni's "make-up" was rather
                        weird: so far as I could see in the dim light that surrounds Spara- fucile,
                        be had a red wig and an inked blaok beard that looked rather like a section
                        of a mask fastened on to his chin. No one sang badly,but every one seemed
                        bored. “Rigoletto" should be given piecemeal, and not all at once. It is too
                        long and dreary, and the few songs of note in it are all so much alike—for
                        that matter they are just like some of Verdi's other songs. Compare “La
                        donna” to “Di Quells Pira," for instance, or even to "A che l’amore," and
                        you will find almost the same time and accompaniment in all three. And then
                        "Rigoletto" has not the fresh vigour that saves Verdi's worst work as a
                        rule, and makes his best work brilliant. </p>

                        Constructions, by taking advantage of local labour and carefully training
                        same, can carry out contracts at prices unapproachable by Continental firms,

                    <p>THE BALL COTILLON.</p>
                    <p>Those who have to do with the management of Sbepheard'a Hotel have every
                        reason to congratulate themselves on the success of their ball cotillon of
                        last Monday. There is not another hotel in Egypt that could have coped with
                        suoch a situation, or could have provided the accomidation required by the
                        crowds of guests who clamoured for invitations. It is said that over 800
                        people sat down to dinner that evening, and by ten o'clock there must have
                        been close to 1,000 packed in the passages and huge dining-hall, which had
                        been transformed into the ball-room. So great was the crunch that it became
                        impossible to find one's friends, and any detailed account of individuals is
                        impossible. Dancing, too, during the earlier hours of the evening was almost
                        an impossibility, abd not even the very best of dancers could be sure of
                        preserving their partners from untoward contretemps. But whether dancing or
                        lookiog on, there was no lack of excitement and interest in the scene, for
                        amid the ever-changing kaleidoscope of people fresh friends would be
                        discovered at every turn, and never more fitting scenes for the pretty
                        dresses could bave been devised than those afforded by the ball room with
                        its strings of colored lights and long trails of coloured foliage, and the
                        handsome hangings and decorstions of the adjoining ball with its softly
                        playing fountain.</p>
                    <p>The cotillon which gave this ball its special signifigance was marked down
                        towards the end of the programme ; but the first and most important figures
                        commenced much earlier in the evening, and when the crowd was at its height.
                        As last year Dr. Armstrong undertook the arduous task of leader, and with
                        his partner headed the long list of fair women and brave men who paraded
                        room the room. With the distribution of pretty favours, head dresses,
                        sunflower trophies, and the like, a medley and unwonted appearance was given
                        to the dancers as they strove to circle around the room amid the onlookers ;
                        and as the various figures resulted in mere and more favours being
                        dispensed, there were but few who did not carry at least one of these dainty
                        mementoes. But numbers were too great to allow of this graceful and popular
                        dance being carried out in its entirety during the earlier part of the
                        evening, though the prettiest of surprises made its appearanoe before the
                        ordinary business of the programme was resumed. The great long curtains at
                        the end of the room were drawn apart to disclose an immense balloon radiant
                        with eleotric light from within, which floated into the centre of the room.
                        Flowers decorated the body of the balloon, flowers covered the basket which
                        hung before it, and in the centre ot this mass of blooms was a diminutive
                        little person who dispensed his favours with impartiality upon those who
                        clamoured below him. No prettier, or more novel sight could be imagined than
                        this little lad in his decoratad and glowing airship ; and again may the
                        management of Shepheard's be congratulated on having happened on such a
                        brilliant idea.</p>
                    <p>Many people spent the next few dances at super, while those whose
                        requirements were of a simpler nature fouod everything they wanted at the
                        superb buffet which ministered to their wants. Here were to be found all the
                        delicacies of the season, both of a sweet and savoury nature, and a thick
                        crowd of both hungry and thirsty pleasure seekers buzzed round the groaning
                        tables between the dances for the remainder of the evening. As numbers grew
                        fewer in the ball-room her cotillon figures were introduced, perhaps the
                        most entertaining one being that in which the gentlemen had to make their
                        way in sacks from one end of the room to where the ladies of their choice
                        sat at the other, the ladies wearing round their necks large velvet hearts
                        with suitable motroes inscribed thereon.</p>
                    <p>The delightful music supplied by the sextett orchestra kept things going till
                        after three o'clock; and when the last tired but still cheer- ful parties
                        left the room tha curtain was rung down at what must be remembered as one of
                        the very best balls ever known in Cairo.</p>
                    <p>As before mentioned the list of dinners served in the hotel that night
                        numbered some eight hundred, and no accurate list can be given of those
                        which must have taxed the cuisine to it utmost. But among the parties
                        mention must be made of that given by Major and Mrs E. S. Herbert, whose
                        guests included Capt. and Mrs. Hunter, Mrs. Stanley Bird, Miss Gorst, Lord
                        Edward Cecil, and Mr. Carter Wilson; and that given by Messers. Rom and

                    <head>TO THE EDITOR TO THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE"</head>
                    <p>Dear Sir,—Allow me to say a few words about your leading article of
                        yesterday, ‘The German Elections." According to my opinion— and I think this
                        opinion-- will be shared by all of your readers who have any sense of
                        logic-- the conclusionss arrived at in this article and the interpretation
                        it gives to the result of the German elections, are simply absurd. Let me
                        prove it by briefly tracing the history of these elections, which may
                        perhaps be unknown to many of your readers.</p>
                    <p>In December last the Reichstag refused, by a small majority, the credits
                        which the Government had asked for the continuation of the war in South
                        Africa. Now the Government had every reason to believe that this vote was
                        not in accordance with the views of the majority of the nation and that this
                        Reichstag, which had been elected four years ago, was not the true
                        representative of German opinion any more. The Reichstag was there- fore
                        dissolved, and the German electors were asked to say their word in the
                        matter. This they have done now, and as far as we can see, and if the second
                        ballots do not change the aspect of things, the nation has decided in favour
                        of the continuation of the war and for the maintenance of the colony, as was
                        to be expected.</p>
                    <p>Now suppose the same thing had happened in England. Suppose the Boer war was
                        to break out again, and a majoirty of "Little Englanders” in Parliament
                        refused the necessary credits to the Government. Then Parliament would be
                        dissolved and an appeal made to the electors who would certainly return a
                        majority in favour of the war. Now would you, in this aase. publish a
                        leading article saying that the British nation had deaided to be governed
                        directly by King Edward and his representatives, in preference to exercising
                        themselves a controlling influence over their destiny in That the British
                        people had replied to King Edward’s challenge with all due submissiveness
                        and had deliberve by thrown away their rights. Certainly not or if you did,
                        everybody would think it nonsense. Way, then, say such things in our case,
                        which is absolutely identical, and describe as a decision in favour of a it
                        in favor to autocratic what was simply the vote of the nation in a single
                        political question.</p>
                    <p>Some time ago you depleted it in your very paper that the German press, when
                        writing about Great Britain, was often showing much misapprehension and
                        ignorance of the real facts. Allow me to say that, to judge by yesterday's
                        article. this apparently not united to German journalists alone, but that
                        their British colleagues. to seem often to blame for the same imperfectors

                        <p>THE ENGLISH IN EGYPT.</p>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE"</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir, --Will you kindly allow me to make a few remarks upon a letter
                            signed "G.J.S,” Cairo, 9th January published in your paper. It is
                            evident that "G. J. S." has not studied the question why the English are
                            not liked by the Egyptians in spite of the benefits of English rule,
                            for, to attribute this want of feeling to the unsociability of the
                            English individual is childish. In my opinion it is going too far to say
                            that the English are hated by the people over whom they rule. The most
                            that one may say is that they are not liked, and that is, I think, very
                            natural. His tory, which is worth more than any newspaper arguments,
                            teaches us that no people with any claim to racial distinction has ever
                            put up with foreign rule, however just and light that rule was. And to
                            expeot from any such people to love the race that has by some means or
                            other subjugated them, is ridioulous.</p>
                        <p>"G. J. S." says that he himself loves and esteems the Engliah because he,
                            as an exceptional, has had some opportunities of assooiating with the
                            English. Surely, unless “G. J. S ” is a "rare avis," there most exist in
                            the British colonies a large number of persons who have had "G. J. S.”
                            opportunities, and yet the persons in the British colonies that prefer
                            English rule to home rule are not many, and still less are those that
                            love the English.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that "G J S" has not had the execptional opportunities he
                            claims to have had ; otherwise, he would have been in a position to
                            attribute this "dislike to British rule" to more natural causes than the
                            unsocialbility of the English character. I am ready to agree with "G. J.
                            S." that English officials in the colonies (I had better say of one
                            colony only, for unlike "G J. S." my experienoe does not extend to all
                            British oolonies) do not associate much with the native element. But
                            this, also, is very natural. Britishers are not cosmopolitan, although
                            they know the world better than the people of any other country. Their
                            daily life is ruled by certain strict rules of etiquette which differs
                            from the etiquette of any other European races. Their habits and
                            inclinations, their manners and tastes, generally differs. They are in
                            this respect a people apart from the rest of the people of Europe, with
                            the result that a Britisher finds it very difficult to be "chummy" with
                            a foreigner. If there, the Britishers cannot make themselves at home in
                            a French or German house, and they are not "at their ease" in the
                            company of other Europeans, how can ‘"G. J. S." expect them to cultivate
                            the society of Orientals whose habits and manners are still farther away
                            from them than those of other Europeans. To ask ann Englishman,for
                            instance, to make himself "at home" in an Oriental gentleman's house
                            where are served for dinner a dozen so dishes of unknown composition and
                            of well-known but unrelished odours, and where the ladies of the house
                            entertain him with a narghileh and a plate of salted bonbons before
                            them, is asking for the impossible.</p>
                        <p>No; I am afraid that G. J. S ” knows very little of ths Englishman's
                            domestic life-- likes and dislikes. We all know that Britishes were
                            liked in Egypt before their occupation of it, and why are Britishers
                            liked anD appreciated in such places as France, Italy and Swizerland. It
                            is because all the admirers of the Britishers in these countries have
                            had the exceptional opportanities of "G. J. S." ? -- Yours

                        <p>Sir,-- Some of your readers who are intendingg to visit Europe may be
                            glad to hear of an unusually charming and attractive spot in the
                            Tyrol,but as yet littleknown though very easily teached from Italy or
                            Trieste Windisch Matrei is the chief village of this district, and is
                            very favourably situated for excursions, being at the juncture of three
                            valleys, all og great beauty. It is a good mountaineering centre, and
                            have also attractions for the angler and for the antiquarin. Tne river
                            supplies several mile, of good trout fishing, best in June and Sep-
                            tember, and in the neighbourhood are two very ancient churches, both
                            decorated with curious and interesting frescoes. ON the road to the
                            churches are two most remarkable pillars with frescoes but unfortunately
                            notnothing authentic is known of their origin.Traces of Roman occupation
                            exist in the neighborhood, many coins having been dog up, and parts of
                            the grand old Castle of Weissenstein, which stand- about 200 feet above
                            the village, are said to have been built by them. This interesting old
                            castle has bean judiciously restored and fitted with every modern
                            requirement, and now accomidates a little over 34 visitors. I- is
                            conducted on the lines of a first class English country house, and is
                            open from June 1st till the end of October. In the castle grounds are
                            two well kept tennis courts. The elevation of the castle is 3,110ft.
                            above sea level, and the air is particularly bracing and pure,
                            Weissenstein Castle is suitable for a prolonged stay, and has the
                            advantage of being off the usual tourist routes. The station is Lienz in
                            the Punter Valley about one hour and a half by train from Toblacb, the
                            well-known entrance to the Ampezzi Vallay in the region of the
                            Dolomites. From Lientz the castle is reached in a little over three
                            hours by private carriage, or somewhat longer by public diligence.</p>

                    <p>A GOOD WORD FOR PE-RU-NA</p>
                    <p>MR.S.D. FOSS 116 S. E. 6th street, Minneapolis, Minn., writes: I wish to
                        congratulate you on your medicine, Peruna. I have been a sufferer with
                        cararrh of the stomach for over two years, but since I have commenced to
                        take your remedy I have been steadily improving until now I can safely say I
                        feel no more of my old trouble, and as a matter of course, I will always
                        have a good workd for Peruna.</p>
                    <p>"I recommend it to all of my friends."</p>
                    <p>PRAISE FOR PE-RU-NA</p>
                    <p>Ms. Magdalena Winkler, Routs 4, Westminster, Md., writes: I thank youv er
                        much for your advice. I can safely say that Peruna and Manalin have saved my
                        life. When I wrote to you the first time, asking your advice, my condition
                        was sao poor that I did not expect to live through the winter, but now I am
                        perfectly healthy. I cannot praise your medicine enough and I recommend it
                        to others.</p>
                    <p>GAINED 10 LBS. IN WEIGHT</p>
                    <p>T.T. Markland, a well-known buisness man of Cincinnatio, O., writes from 3100
                        Woodburn Ave., as follows: I find that in my case Peruna is a flesh builder.
                        I am now at work everyday, and have gained ten pounds. I rook your Peruna
                        according to directions, and the result was more than I expected. I can now
                        breathe wise ease and also my couch is stopped. I had it for six months
                        before I took down with the grip. I took no other medicine but Peruna and it
                        accomplished all. You told me in your first letter that Peruna would cure me
                        and it has. I am seventy-three-years old and can attend to my work and
                        business as usual.</p>
                    <p>GIVES PE-RU-NA CREDIT</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Theone Mikkelson, Brigham City, Utah, writes: I wish to thank your for
                        all the good Peruna has done me, I am entirely free from cough which used to
                        bother me so much every winter. My kidneys are also in good coniditon and I
                        feel stronger and better allover. For all three I give the credit to your
                        excellent medcine, Peruna. I am pleased to recommend it to everybody.</p>
                    <p>For special directions everyone should read: "The Ills of Life," a copy of
                        which surrounds each bottle. Peruma is for sale by all chemists and
                        druggists at five shillings per bottle or six bottles for twenty-five
                        shillings. Those wishing direct correspondence with Dr. Hartman and can wait
                        the necessary delay in recieving should adress Dr. S. B. Hartman, Columbus,
                        Ohio, U.S.A. The following wholesale druggists will supply the retain drug

                    <head>UPPER EGYPT</head>
                    <p>THE LUXURIES OF TRAVEL</p>
                    <p>Though of course there is no way of traveling in Egypt to pleasant as by
                        dababieb, there are many to whom time is an object, and who cannot indulge
                        in this easy and deliberate method of seeing the country. The railway
                        journey between Cairo and Assouan in the past has often been held up to
                        contumely; but really at the present moment, when it comes to an honest
                        analysis, the journey is by no means a tedious one : and indeed it is a
                        remarkable achievement when one considers the difficulties under which the
                        line has been engineered, and the natural conditions surrounding it.</p>
                    <p>For the sake of argument, let us suppose the jonrney to Assouan has been
                        undertaken by dshabieb, and then let us take the return trip from Assouan
                        Cairo by the mail train, which leaves the former place every day during the
                        winter season at 10.15 a.m. Those who remember the dusty, inconvenient
                        little station of Assouan planed across the road by the landing stage will
                        not recognize the trim garden with its spin-and-span little buildings of red
                        brick and turquoise cloured woodwork now enclosed by a neat walk and
                        fencing. No longer a rabble crowd gathers before the booking office: for
                        separate entraces divide the different classes, and no one is allowed to
                        enter on the platform without a ticket, even though the ticket is issued for
                        that purpose alone. Fresh arrangements are also made in the matter of
                        luggage, which no longer cumbers the platform, but which is taken straight
                        to its own department to be weighed and registered and placed upon the train
                        without confusion. In the same way the arriving luggage is removed from the
                        vans at the further end of the platform and carried away through another
                        exit without ever encroaching on the platforms. A neat telegraph office
                        stands in line with the booking office and that of the International Wagons
                        Lits Company, and on the other side of it if a comfortable and airy
                        waiting-room prettily furnished with basket chairs, the lavatory
                        accommodation being also in a separate building well kept and filled with
                        all necessaries, clean towels and soap being among its luxuries. The train,
                        which still runs on the narrow gauge (3ft 6 in.) single line is composed of
                        first-class coaches and restaurant cars painted white in addition to the
                        ordinary rolling stock. These long white coaches are divided each into two
                        compartments with tiled lavatory accommodation in the centre. The
                        compartments are not furnished as in ordinary trains, but have a sofa seat
                        each side on ball their length, the remaining space being occupied by easy
                        chairs with leather cushions and tables. The windows are protected as far as
                        possible from the sand and sun by glass windows, both colourless and blue,
                        as well as the ordinary</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>shutters. An ice chest is also added to each compartment, so that passengers
                        can carry a few necessary and grateful drinks with them if they wish to do
                        so, and for the extra-luxurious there are spocial carriages which can be
                        attached to the train at special rates. The restaurant cars are as
                        comfortable as they can be, and are furnished with electric fans. Here
                        lunches are served either a la carte or from the menu and there is a
                        separate small saloon for those who wish for extra meals, for teas, or such
                        like, at odd times.</p>
                    <p>So much for Assouan station and the train as they stand at the moment. They
                        argue well for those who here had to do with them during the last few
                        months, and compare most favourably with the conditions existing even last
                        winter. There are rumours in the air of still greater improvements to be
                        made in the future; of the possibility of the wider gauge and double line,
                        with the continuation of a more elaborate service but these things still lie
                        in the laps of the gods, and a certain number of years are bound to elapse
                        before their consummation.</p>
                    <p>Jonrneying Itz'y by dahabieh one sees of course the native life of the river
                        banks, but little of that which lies beyond. From the elevation of that
                        train one learns far more of the country around, and as it winds its way
                        across the desert, through mud villages, and skirting the fields of crops,
                        the groves of palms, etc., etc., the hours slip by with many of j cts of
                        interest to pass the time away. Right throngh the heart of Assouan runs the
                        line, a crowd of women and children turning out to spell the parting train
                        as it borrows in and out through the close built walls, through rough
                        cuttings and out past the mud encampments and cemetery beyond. For many
                        miles the rails form the dividing line between the cultivated ground upon
                        ths river side and the stony stony of the desolate hill sides, and its track
                        serves in the absence of the train as the chief thoroughfare for beast and
                        waylarer.</p>
                    <p>Through Khattore, now curving by the river bank, now far away across the
                        desert with the mountains fading away into the distance. stopping for a few
                        minutes at Daraw, a quite important native town, with a crowd of women and
                        children at the station selling brightly coloured woven bags and flags, and
                        so on to Kom-Ombo with the beautiful temple hidden by the hill behind it and
                        the hideous water works, blazoning the commercial prosperity of its future.
                        The native town is a large one; European houses are springing up round the
                        station and the large area of land enclosed by deep dykes is that pet sc
                        heme in which Sir Ernest Cassel is so much interested. Silwa and Serag are
                        passed duringg the hour for lunch, an excellent meal and excellently served,
                        end from the station of Edfon there is no glimpse of the temple which lies
                        across the further side of the river. At Mahamid one notices the frequent
                        pigeon towers and also some attempt to beautify the mud village houses with
                        triangular pointed cornices of coloured </p>

                <div type="article">
                    <p>bricks. The station of Esneb lies some 1 1/2 mile from the river and away
                        from the town, which shows faintly on its opposite bank. The tract between
                        the station and the river is given over to the machinations of Sir John Aird
                        and Co. and is covered with huge piles of stone, and all the desolation of
                        desolation which must perforce accompany the stupendous work which is being
                        there erected. The hill side between Matana andChagab are now being quarried
                        for the same purpose, busy swarms of workers hanging like flies upon its
                        surface.</p>
                    <p>The heat of the day has passed its zenith before one gets to Armant, after
                        which one can let down the window and enjoy the glorious view over the
                        window and verdant plain with no thought of dust interfering with one's plea
                        sure ; and before the sun has gone to rest the trusty train has landed one
                        in Luxor station, if somewhat dusty and thirsty still but little tired after
                        the seven hours journey.</p>
                    <p>Here at Luxor the traveler has a grateful change and rest till 6.30, when the
                        night mail bears him away to Cairo. So there is time to test the resources
                        of the station, shake the dust from one's clothes, enjoy an ample ablution
                        in a commodious dressing-room, and thoroughly appreciate a welcome thirst
                        quencher, either tea or otherwise, on the verandah which is attached to the
                        station buffet, and which is in the hands of the Wagons Lits Company.</p>
                    <p> By six o'clock the long mail train is in the Station, so there still remains
                        half an hour to find one's compartment and leisurely bestow one's belongings
                        to best advantage luck is in the ascendant one gets a compartment all to
                        oneself, and can study one’s own comfort all the time, open windows and
                        ventilators at one own sweet will, set miniature electric fans a-working,
                        and admire one's own appearance without let or hindrance at no less than
                        three looking glasses of goodly proportions. The seats are wide and
                        delightfully cushioned, the dressing room quite replete, with a basin
                        commodious enough to satisfy the most particular. While in the restaurant
                        can discussing dinner, the attendants have been busy setting out the beds,
                        so that on one’s return to the compartment one is almost tempted there and
                        then to disrobe and test their quality. One’s ticket has also been removed
                        from one's custody, so that there is no fear of having the night made
                        hideous by frequent visits by the collectors all eager to show their
                        devotion to their duty.</p>
                    <p>So the black hours of the night slip by and unless one is a very delicate
                        sleeper one manages to get a really comfortable rest, for the motion is by
                        no means rough, and there are not many stations to break the continuity of
                        slumber. In the chilly hours of early morn the train was through Kafr Ammah;
                        the sun is well up and flooding the country round Matarieh, breakfast makes
                        a welcome break soon after, and then the familiar features of Cairo
                        surroundings heave in sight, Pyramids of Darsbieh, and of Sakara, on one
                        side ; Helooan sparkling on the side. Then the Pyramids of Ghizereh come
                        nearer, the train crosses the shady road that leads thereto, and the long
                        detour beyond is made which leads to the big bridge below Ghezireh across to
                        Bonlao, and so back to the big terminus at Cairo well up to time, and quite
                        ready to start the busy day with the rest of the world at large. </p>

                    <head>AN AMERICAN AT THE COURT OF MENELIK</head>
                    <p>Tbe average B-ilon knows, probably, little shout Abyssinia. Mr. Skinner, the
                        first representative of the United States to visit the Court of the King of
                        Kings, evidently believes that his fellow citizens know nothing of the
                        country. In this belief he has written a book based on the
                        experience—November, 1903- January, 1904—when head of a mission rent to
                        negotiate a treaty of commenrce between the U.S.A. and Menelik II Mr.
                        Skinner went, saw, and was conquered. He imagined himself, and with some
                        reason, an ingestigation of "a civilization which found its inspiration in
                        Solomon's Court.” and with refreshing enthusiasm be records his first
                        impressions of the East, for it is to the East rather than to Africa that
                        Abyssinia, save geographically, belongs. For the Negros he displays a
                        whole-hearted admiration, crediting him with "the constructive intelligence
                        of a Bismarck, and the faculty for handling men by sheer amiability of a
                        McKinley” Mr. Skinner's descriptions of the ex- periences of the mission
                        alike capital reading his comments on trade and commerce are much to the
                        point.</p>
                    <p>Concerning the Abyssinians themselves, their history, their religion, their
                        laws, and such-like matters, the information given is somewhat crude and
                        elementary, nor altogether free from error-e.g. the irritating references to
                        Christopher de Gama. But the point if view taken is always novel and usually
                        round. Perhaps the real defect of the bank lies in the fact that the author
                        saw only the very best side of the Abyssinians, and writer as if the whole
                        nation was equal to the samples tested. We heartily commend the volume to
                        all seeking an introduction to Abyssinian affairs and to the larger class of
                        leaders who want a story of real living interest. As the object of the
                        American mission was to overcome the effect of tariff barriers on the
                        development of trade, there is also matter of moment in the book to Free
                        Trader and Tariff Reformer alike. British political influence is strong in
                        the country." The Abyssinian market is one well worth an effort to secure.
                        We hope our mercahnts will take the hint.</p>

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                            Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines
                            are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
                            travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                            without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by
                            P.&amp;O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                            Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be
                            seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                            The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of
                            S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The
                            Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also
                            worth a visit.</p>

                        <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                            springs, change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are
                            at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                            Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio
                            opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio
                            is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake
                            Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                            is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated
                            above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings,
                            “Entombment," by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance
                        with the printed directions accompanying it, will the shattered health be
                        restored,</p>

                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>

                    <p>Coleman's "Wincarnis" is one of the best restoratives know to medical
                        science. Hitherto its use has been principally directed to the recuporation
                        of convalescents, but is beneficial effect is now recognised to be quite as
                        essential for those who are comparatively well as for those who are, or have
                        been, ill. The strong tonic effect is particularly valubale to the men of
                        business who experiance a considerable amount of worry and anxiety. Doctors
                        prescribe "Wincarnis" for women suffering from nervous exhuation and for
                        young girls anemic. It is especially appreciated by the medical profession
                        for speedy blood enrichment. It never fails to increase the natural stamina
                        of the nervous system. Sole Manufacturers | COLEMAN &amp; Co., LTD.,
