                    <head>THE REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA.</head>
                    <p>The situation in Russia does not show any improvement. On every side there is
                        chaos, and every day the condition of Russia goees from worse to worse, and
                        the startling evidences of organisation that are provided by the wholesale
                        extent of the area of revolt are driving many observers to "hail the dawn"
                        for Russia as Fox did for France. The revolutionary movement has been
                        compared to that which took place in France after the assemblage of the
                        States-General: and the parallel is a striking, and in many respects a just
                        one. But if the Russians, as has been remarked, have greater difficulties to
                        face before they can achieve freedom, since they have not even the tradition
                        of it, and no feeling of national unity such as animated France, there is
                        one point on which they possess an enormous advantage. Throughout the French
                        Revolution the Roman Catholic Church was practically a negligible quantity:
                        if it attracted attention, it was only because it inspired the passionate
                        hate of the Mountain, and the ridicule of the Sansculottes. But the Church
                        in Russia has played a part that it has never attempted in Western Europe.
                        Since the Empire was established a thousand years ago, it has been in the
                        van of every national movement. It has blessed the expeditions against the
                        Tartars and the Turks; it has endeavored to be the protector of all the
                        Oriental Christians; it has sympathised with the peasant in his distress,
                        and at times it has formulated the Imperial policy. But last January it was
                        a priest of the Church who led the workmen at St. Petersburg: and it is
                        significant in the highest degree that the clergy seem now to have abandoned
                        the Government. If they, whose influence is naturally exerted in favor of
                        the Autocracy, turn against it, what can be expected of that vast mass of
                        people who are wavering in their allegiance, and what excesses may not be
                        anticipated from those who have already decided on Revvolution as the one
                        thing needful to save their country? The fate of Russia lies in her own
                        hands. Whether a measure of popular control is to bbe the ultimate rule for
                        the Muscovite Empire rests with the people. The sole result visible at
                        present iis complete stagnation of commerce, and absolute chaos everywhere.
                        Until her internal affairs are decided, Russia will hardly count among the
                        Councils of the Great Powers: and the situation, unfortunately, reacts on
                        the rest of Europe disastrously, not only so far as business is concerned,
                        but in graver fashion as giving dangerous opportunities for ambition
                        elsewhere. </p>

                            entente, when the time is ripe for the latter ; but definite political
                            steps are inopportune while the present | disturbed state of Russia
                            continues. It is felt, however, that it is already possible to pave the
                            way, by the revision of the commercial treaty, in view of closer
                            commercial relations. (Reuter) </p>

                    <p>The great excitement which was display¬ed on the Alexandria and Cairo Bourses
                        yesterday, in the rash to dispose of Salt and Soda shares, was renewed this
                        morning, when a further fall took place and lens of thousands of shares were
                        disposed of. At midday some strong buyers appeared on the market and a
                        slight recovery took place. The shares closed when we went to press at 24s.
                        6d.</p>
                    <p>It is stated that the Egyptian Government has withdrawn the salt concession,
                        but that there are grounds for believing that an arrangement will be arrived
                        at between the company and the Government, so that a modus vivendi may be
                        established. This news is, however, not official, but merely the substance
                        of what is alleged on the Alexandria Bourse.</p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer’s remarks on the subject in his last Report are worthy of
                        quotation at the present juncture. His lordship says "I regard this (the
                        salt monopoly) as one of the greatest of the remaining blots on the existing
                        fiscal system. A country lest adapted for a monopoly of salt than Upper
                        Egypt can hardly be imagined. The desert is full of salt, which can be had
                        for the trouble of taking it away. In the long narrow strip of inhabited
                        land, there are but few villages which are far from some salt deposit
                        Smuggling, of course, takes place and it is practically impossible to stop
                        it. In 1904, 1,716 cases of contraband occurred; the number of persons fined
                        or imprisoned was 1,223. In the remaining cases, the salt was seized, and
                        the animals used in smuggling were confiscated. The number of animals thus
                        confiscated was 489. The offenders rarely, if ever pay the fines imposed,
                        and, I conceive, do not much mind being imprisoned for a short t mo.
                        Confiscation of the animals is probably a more severe punishment, as it must
                        often reduce the culprits, who are all very poor, to a state of indigence.
                        Although no domiciliary visits are ever made to search for salt, it cannot
                        be doubted that the measures taken to repress the contraband trade axe
                        rightly regarded by the population as oppressive. I hope, therefore, that
                        the financial situation will, at tome future time, permit of a Urge
                        reduction in the royalty now paid on salt A small reduction would merely
                        involve a loss of revenue, and would not lead to any considerable increase
                        of consumption.”</p>
                    <p>The revenue derived from the salt monopoly in 1904 was L.E. 182,000 as
                        compared to L.E. 169,000 in 1903 ; 60,000 tons of salt were consumed. This
                        is at about the rate of 5.4 kilos, per head of population. The normal
                        consumption in most European countries is considerably higher than this
                        figure.</p>
                    <p>Prior to 1892, all salt was sold direct by the Government at a price of P.T.
                        800 a ton. It is now sold by the company at P.T. 500 a ton. The Government
                        receive a royalty out of this sum of no less than P.T. 310 a ton.</p>

                    <p>At 10 a.m. yesterday the 2nd Chambre Civile of the Cairo Mixed Court was
                        asleep, or st least nodding : oases of small importance Ironed along— some
                        of the members of the Bench were obviously drowsy and the audience bored. At
                        last Judge Herzbruch called the Poutrel Davey case,—No. 50 on the roll sod
                        the audience and Bench awoke in earnest Me. Guilhanmon opened the case for
                        his client shortly before 11 a.m. and for the next forty minutes kept the
                        Court interested, for his speech contained some most interesting passages
                        described in piteons terms the plight of M. Poutrel, summoned from Europe by
                        an urgent wire and dismissed within three hours of bis arrival at Cairo, and
                        then discussed the reasons of his dismissal. Obviously, the Hon. A. J. Davey
                        and others bad sought a scapegoat and M. Poutrel had been selected for this
                        office : the whole beard had done its utmost to escape from the incubus of
                        their responsibility for the crash, some had failed, and the Hon. A J.
                        Davey's attempts could impose on no one. How could he explain sway the
                        letter that ha had written to his colleagues on the board ? -the letter
                        containment the statement of Mr. X, who informed the Hon. A. J. Davey in the
                        Turf Club that Sir Ernest Cassel had told him in the presence of Birch Pasha
                        many things, and this among others, that if he did not take the Sucreries in
                        hand a smash was inevitable, and that he did not know how they got their
                        dividends and meant to go into the question.”</p>
                    <p>Counsel for the defence suggested that the letter might as well be produced.
                        Mr. Guilhaumon declined, but stated that he believed in its existence and
                        contained to take its most interesting passages as his text All, be said.
                        pointed to the fact that the Hon. A. J. Davey knew all and had known all
                        along before the crash, nor did he fail to avail himself of other arguments.
                        Defendant had signed the balance- sheets, could he have possibly been
                        ignorant of their true meaning? And much more to that effect. Then back to
                        the famous letter : it existed, so he believed, but he would not produce it,
                        and so saying he sat down at 11.35 a.m and Mo. Carton de Wiart took up the
                        defence.</p>
                    <p>Then came the first sensation Counsel for the defence would like to know
                        whether plaintiff’s counsel had seen the original or the copy of the letter.
                        A brief verbal skirmish followed, and then Me. Carton de Wiart startled the
                        Court and the audience by the statement that the letter had been stolen
                        "with effraction” from the Sugar Company’s safe, to which Me. Guilhaumon
                        retorted that be was not the Public Prosecutor.</p>
                    <p>Then came the defence. M Poutrel was bringing a personal action, but the Hon.
                        A J. Davey had acted as he had done in his official capacity of
                        administrator delegate, acting manager, in fact, of the whole business. On
                        September 2l, he had written officially to the board concerning M. Poutrel,
                        and the board had given him carte blanche to dismiss M. Poutrel or accept
                        his resignation. The letter was there, and what evidence could be clearer?
                        Then came another incident Me. Guilhaumon claimed that the letter had not
                        been communicated to him. “No," replied Me. Carton de Wiart, "it was
                        communicated to you last night,” and added that he had himself written to
                        the papers on the subject stating that the Hon. A. J. Davey's conduct bad
                        been approved by the hoard, and that Me. Guilhaumon bad replied also in the
                        columns of the Press. Counsel for the plaintiff argued that tie Press was
                        not the proper medium for the communication of documents. Counsel for
                        defendant replied briskly and then Me Guilhaumon, on the ground that he had
                        not studied or seen the document, asked for the postponement of the hearing.
                        It was granted, and shortly before midday a most interesting trial was

                    <p>About eight yean ego a case of highway robbery and murder occurred in the
                        Mariont district, which at that time was in the Kafr Dawar marker. A
                        Bedouin, of the name of Abou Shalot, belonging to a family notorious for its
                        lawlessness, was accused of the crime. He could not be found, so he was
                        sentenced in his absence to penal servitude for life.</p>
                    <p>The police have been persistently looking for him ever since, and about three
                        years ago a rumour was brought to their ears that this man was lurking in
                        the neighbourhood. The police officer in charge of the district, Abdul Axim
                        Wahbi Effendi, went out into the desert on the criminal’s trail, but Abou
                        Shalot laid an ambush for him and badly wounded the officer and placed a
                        shawish and a naffir hors de combat, while he succeeded in making good his
                        escape.</p>
                    <p>For the last two years, since the Alexandria police have taken over the
                        Mariont district, they have never ceased to look out for Shalot and on
                        Monday morning, owing to secret in-formation, the mamour of the district,
                        with an armed patrol of smart Sudanese policemen, went off eastwards from
                        Amrieh and found Shalot in a home, waiting for them with a gun in his hand
                        He was disarmed before he could do any damage, and was brought into

                        total of about 1,550, M. Schwob says it is impossible for him to enumerate
                        all the business houses which they control indirectly. </p>
                    <p>"As a great part of our merchandise passes through Antwerp it is watched,
                        manipulated and labelled by them," writes Mr.Schwob, referring, of course,
                        to French commerce. "They take note of our clients and of theirr tastes and
                        then one fine day our custom will be stolen from us by skilful imitations at
                        a reduced price. Even the banking business is invaded. Out of 14
                        administrators of the Central Bank in Antwerp, six, including the president
                        and vice-president, are German."</p>
                    <p>M. Schwob further observes that the Germans are repeating the samme process
                        at Rotterdam, but more slowly and with greater difficulty, owing to the more
                        effective resistance offered by the Dutch. </p>

                    <p>The experiments now being carried on by the Tokio Government, with a view to
                        rendering Japan more independent of Indian and American suppliies of raw
                        cotton, have a very living interest for Lancashire. Should success crown the
                        endeavor, the close proximity of the islands to China will necessarily give
                        their cotton manufactures a great advantage in that almost limitless
                        market.Our allies already possess the other leading requisites for supplying
                        Chinese requirements. The cotton cloths they manufacture are both moderate
                        in price and very durable, while the Japanese mill-hand willingly accepts
                        wages on which Lancashire operatives would half-starve. They also work much
                        longer hours, and their natural ingenuity in design gives them additional
                        advantage. Up to the present, however, the still infant industry has been
                        heavily handicapped by such an insufficiency of the raw material that nearly
                        a million sterling per annum has had to be paid in gold for imports. The
                        central purpose, therefore, of the Marquis Ito's personal inquiry in Korea
                        is to ascertain whether that new appanage of Japan can be depended on to eke
                        out the cotton producing resources of the islands. It will be seen that the
                        object is much the same as that of the English Cotton Growing Association-
                        the prevention of "cornering" by foreign speculators whenever the extraneous
                        supply seems likely to run short of the world's wants. </p>

                    <head>ARE DISEASES INCREASING?</head>
                    <p>There can be no question, says the "Practitioner," that the prevalence of
                        certain diseases has increased during the last half century. Conspicuous
                        among these are diabetes and insomnia, both of which are largely due to the
                        mental stress of a harder struggle for existence. The increased consumption
                        of alcohol, and the free use of narcotics, are also responsible for many
                        morbid conditions unknown to our hardier forbears. But, in comparing the
                        present prevalence of diseases with that of the past, there are several
                        facotrs for which due allowance is often not made. One of thses is that our
                        forefathers died, as a rule, at a considerably younger age than thei
                        descendants; if they did not perish by the sword, they were mowed down from
                        time to time by the plague, or other devastating epidemics. In this way they
                        escaped many of the diseases not only of old age but of advanced middle
                        life. Again, it must not be forgotten that each generation represented to a
                        much larger extent than is now the case the survival of the fittest. Most of
                        the weaklings died in childhood. The triumph of modern hygiene is, that it
                        has preserved a large proportion of these lives; on this we may fairly pride
                        ourselves from the humanitarian point of view, but we must not shut our eyes
                        to the fact that it has the serious drawback of lowering the general
                        standard of health,and of sapping the vigour of the race. Another factor
                        which must be taken into account in estimating the prevalence of diseases is
                        our vastly greater power of recognising them. Discussing this question in an
                        article which recently appeared in the "Nouvelle Revue," Dr. P.L. Hauser
                        says:-</p>
                    <p>"What then is the cause of the multiplication of disease? Is this
                        multiplication merely apparent, being due first to the progress of natural
                        science and then to the new knowledge which we have obtained with reference
                        to pathology? While the fact of this new knowledge is indisputable this last
                        hypothesis is insufficient to explain the absolute silence, maintained by
                        the most distinguished physicians of past years, with reference to a great
                        many of the diseases of our epoch. While biological science has made immense
                        strides in recent years, we cannot deny to the physicians of ancient times a
                        profound spirit of observation. Yet we look in vain for the least mention of
                        diseases such as diphteria, progressive locomotor ataxia, progressive
                        muscular atrophy, Parkinson's disease, Basedow's disease, general paralysis
                        of the insane, and the different sorts of cerebrospinal sclerosis, all of
                        which are frequent to-day."</p>
                    <p>Dr. Hauser's remark is, the "Practitioner" thinks, too sweeping. A very fair
                        description of diphtheria is to be found in Aretaeus. It is by no means safe
                        to infer, because no mention is to be found in old writers of diseases of
                        obscure and perplexing symptomatology, that they did not exist. This
                        argument would equally prove that many other diseases are of modern
                        development. Round ulcer of the stomach was so utterly unknown in the
                        seventeenth century, that the discovery of the lesion at the postmortem
                        examination of the body of a Royall princess was held to be a proof of
                        poisoning, and for political reasons was explained away as the result of an
                        awkward use of the scissors. Appendicitis again may be more common now than
                        formerly, but we know that it did exist long before it was generally
                        recognised, and it may fairly be assumed that it has existed since man had
                        an appendix. Yet there is no mentionn of it in the ancient writers. </p>

                    <head>AUSTRIA IN MACEDONIA.</head>
                    <p>There are four conflicting purposes which divide the European Powers on the
                        question of Macedonia. The first is that of Great Britain, who is followed
                        by France and Italy. It is altruistic and recognises that Macedonia should
                        be freed from the Sultan. The second is the cynical policy of Germany, who
                        desires to be friends with the Sultan, and is, therefore, hostile to the
                        altruisic idea. The third was that of Russia before the war, which consisted
                        in urging on Bulgaria to war with Turkey so that she might step in and
                        promote a rec-ification of frontiers to her own advantage. The fourth policy
                        is that of Austria, whose people are closely in contact with the
                        Macedonians, whose traders have been first on the spot, and whose
                        capitalists have acquired great interests in the country. As Mr. R. A.
                        Scott-James points out in the "Fortnightly Review," Austria has nothing to
                        gain by any sudden change in the Government of Macedonia, for if the present
                        state of things continues, her securities in the country, and consequently
                        her control of the country, will be such that she will have practically
                        absorbed Macedonia, as Russia was in process of absorbing Macedonia, as
                        Russia was in process of absorbing Manchuria. Peace and order are necessary
                        to her plans, and she desires just so much reform as will stave off
                        revolution without destroying the supremacy of the Porte. Austria has so far
                        won all along the line, for the other five Powers, Russia owing to her
                        misfortunes, have all waived their own policies and played into her hands,
                        while the unfortunate people of Macedonia have continued to be the pawns of
                        diplomatists.</p>

                    <p>A telegram from Constantinople states that the Superior of the Italian
                        Mission of the Franciscans, Father Joseph Caneve, celebrated a Requiem Mass
                        there for the victims of the earthquakes in Calabria, in the presence of the
                        Italian Ambassador and Consul-General, the officers of the Italian
                        guardship, and the members of the Italian colony. It will be remembered that
                        Father Caneve, in obedience to the orders of the Vatican, informed the
                        French Ambassador at Constantinople, in September last, that being unwilling
                        any longer to remain under the Protectorate of France he had placed himself
                        under the Protectorate of Italy. The other religious missions sent their
                        Superiors to the Requiem Mass, which inaugurated the taking possession of
                        the Italian missions at Constantinople by the Italian Ambassador.</p>

                    <head>BRITAIN AND ITS NEIGHBOURS</head>
                    <p>The "Edinburgh Review" takes a hopeful view of the future relations of the
                        Powers. In sober truth, it remarks, is there reasonable ground for
                        anticipating the occurrence of a life-and-death struggle between the British
                        Empire and a combination against it of the great nations of the Continent?
                        Is it quite rational to anticipate a future in which the United Kingdom, the
                        centre of the commerce of the whole world, will be perforce entirely
                        dependent upon its internal resources, and will glare out, so to speak, from
                        behind its moat, and with its drawbridges raised, against millions of
                        encircling foes panting for its de- struction? It is sufficiently lamentable
                        that in the early years of the twentieth century so gloomy a prospect should
                        loom before the eyes of Englishmen. We have, assuredly, no right to
                        calculate on perpetual peace. It is possible on the other hand, to give too
                        much rein to the imagination in picturing the dangers of the coming years. .
                        . . When we take a general survey of our own position in either hemi-
                        sphere, we are quite unable to see that it necessitates the taking of such
                        gigantic mea- sures as are recommended to us. Lord Roberts is unjust in
                        suggesting that the British people are either indifferent to military
                        matters or that they are unwilling to make sacrifices. But reasonable men
                        ought at least carefully to weigh the real danger of their condition before
                        they saddle themselves with burdens which must greatly hamper the growth and
                        prosperity of the people. </p>

                    <p>There is a passage in one of the ancient Arab histories in which the
                        statement is made that "the white people come from the other side of the
                        sea," and that perfectly plain and intelligible statement has been so
                        distorted that the belief widely prevailed throughout the Western Sudan that
                        white men oame from the bottom of the ses. This belief has been found to
                        exi-t both in British and b Frenbh territory. It was, indeed, on one
                        occasion turned somewhat ingeniously to aoooant by a Pulani Emir whore
                        country was situated some dis- tance from the Niger. In the early days of
                        our occupation of the Niger territory onr activity was, for obvious reasons,
                        oonfioed to the imme- diate neighborhood of the river.Tbis was held strong
                        confirmation ot the theory as to the origin of 'he white man, and the Bmir
                        in ques- tion aotnally informed his sabjeots, who were growing distarbed at
                        the stories they bad heard of the white man’s prowess, that they had nothing
                        to fear from the white men. *s they oonld hot lire away from the water I The
                        taot that a high official took his tub daily was farther considered
                        confirmatory evidence of the submarine origin of the white men. There can be
                        no donbt, also, that the Arabs, in order to ratab their bfluence over the
                        natives, spread broadoast the statement that the white men were cannibals.
                        The fact that, they did not eat black men was explained as due to their
                        devilish onnniog. They wanted . to make themselves strong in the oountry
                        before beginning their horrid practices; but, | as they c >nld not
                        altogether do without this kind of food, they brought homao flash with them
                        in tins. Thus were the tinned meats of the white man made to support this
                        weird j invention. It was only when his men refused 1 to eat the remains of
                        a tin ot meat of whioh he had himself partaken that a well-known | explorer
                        at lougth learned the legend. Tbii was in Bast Central Africa, but in West i
                        Africa a French expedition had the unfor- tunate experience of finding a
                        portion of a | human huger—cut off, no donbt, by some aooident—in a tin of
                        meat Here was fresh and conclusive confirmation of the story, b whioh the
                        people had almost oeased to believe, | and it was only after a considerable
                        lapse of time that the idea was at length eradicated. </p>

                        the spinner, and. to this and we are bending oar efforts. Your pablio

                        eliminate from the cotton trade a large percentage of its speculative
                        nature. Cotton growers are gettbg tired of nncertain condi- tions and want

                        want the prioe to be stable and at near uni- form as possible. Conditions

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir,—Can any of your readers kindly enlight- en me as to the correct
                            derivation of the common word “Galabieh"? Theliterary form is said to be
                            gulbab, plural, guldbeeb. </p>
                        <p>By chance I came across the following quotation in a Latin dictionary :-
                            "Lebitonarium est colobium sine manicis quali monachi Egyptu utuntur," -
                            the lebitonarium is a robe without sleeves, such as Egyptian monks wear.
                            )Isidor. Orig. 7th century).</p>
                        <p>on tracing colobium to the Greek lexican we find, of course, kolos,
                            kolobos, - curtailed, shortened, and kolobion, an under garment with
                            short sleeves. </p>
                        <p>Is it possible that the Arabs, after their conquest of this country in
                            the seventh century, adopted the native smock, and altered "kolobion"
                            into "galabieh"?</p>
                        <p>I have never been able to account for the double "b" in gulbab, galdbeeb.
                            Was this literary form invented by Arabian lexicographers in the hope
                            that the word might be taken to be of pure Arab origin?- You obedient

                    <p>Paris, November 8.</p>
                    <p>Paris has at last definitely accepted the fact that we are within measurable
                        distance of winter, and although one still sees plenty of people seated
                        outside of the cafes at the â€¢absinthe hoor,â€ one ro longer, except at
                        the favorite establishments where there is a first- rate orchestra and mnch
                        life and animation, has tho same ditlicolty in obtaining a seat on the
                        terrace. </p>
                    <p>The Kaiser is disappointed because France has not responded to bis advances.
                        Alsace- Lorraine is, as he perceives, a barrier to a close entente. Ail
                        sorts of suggestions have been made by way of solving the thorny problem,
                        but the latest, whioh emanates, as osual, from a Teutonic source, is so very
                        eocentrio that it really deserves mention. The Emperor would, if this idea
                        were adopted, put the following proposition before the two peoples :
                        Lorraine to be restored to Franoe, who, in return, wonld hand over to
                        Germany Corsica, the southern portion of Madagascar, and Cambodia, it being
                        farther stipulated that neither Power should keep a garrison within
                        twenty-five miles of its frontier. The notion that the French would give up
                        Corsica to the Germans, having them as sooth-eastern, as well as eastern,
                        neighbours, and allowing them to get in the thin end of the wedge in
                        Madagarcarand their lodo China territory, is too unpractical to deserve
                        serious attention for a moment. After all that has recently occurred in
                        oonneotion with Morocco, the suggestion that such a delicate question should
                        be submitted to a referendum of tie two nationsâ€”a step which would be
                        bound to iuoreaÂ«e agitation to fever-heatâ€”stands te'f- oendemned. </p>
                    <p>As a matter of fact, numbers of thoughtful French and German people, who have
                        devoted much consideration to the still vexed question of the lost
                        provinces, have had to confess themselves bstiled by its magnitude. ' Vive
                        TAlsace-Lorraine Frar^iise !" are words that figure prominently on the
                        address issned, in which the League of Patriots invited lovers of their
                        country to join in welcoming M. Paul DEroulEde on his arrival in Paris on
                        Sunday afternoon, and its president, who has returned after his long exile,
                        will certaialy do his at- most to prevent any of bis fellow citizens who may
                        be halting betwoen two opioions from supporting any movement for the
                        conclusion of a close entente with Germany. </p>
                    <p>M. de Lanessan contributes to this morn- ing's "Sifcole" an artiole on the
                        recent toasts of the German Emperor nnder the title "Cresarian Speeches." He
                        dwells on them as being timely demonstrations for the ontand-ont French
                        internationalists, of tho argent need of putting France in ajiroper state of
                        defence. Who can tell, he asks, how far such an antocrat as the German
                        Emperor may go either to please the German war party or to satisfy bis own
                        "Middle Age feelirgit" If his'threats are meant for Franoe, they are quite
                        unjustifiable, for Franoe has done everything in her power since the
                        inexplicable visit to Tangier to be agreeable to Germany while manifesting a
                        sincere desire for peaoe M. de Lanessan con- siders that Frenchmen are
                        entitled to think it very 'singular that Germany should fail to understand
                        the real extent of the saorifioea Franoe has made in acquiescing in the
                        depar- ture of M. DalcassE at tho book and oall of a foreign Power. The
                        German Emperorâ€™s persistent bellicose outbursts are in strange contrast
                        with the protests of friendship in which he formerly indulged. Yet Franoe
                        has never changed her attitude towards Germany. </p>
                    <p>The entente with England, which is the real motive of William Il.â€™a

                        suspicious or provoked German hostility. Like the Franoo-Rusaian allianoe,
                        the entente with Bngland is a necessary guarantee ot peace. It is a mutual
                        precaution against sventual aggression, and how can William II. hope to
                        oonvince any one that France or Bngland intends to at'aok Germany. If the
                        Kaiser sincerely desired pesos he ought to rejoice at the alliance and
                        understandings, but this is manifestly not his state of mind. He is
                        violently opposed to the Anglo, Frenoh entente, and his recent speeches were
                        directed asainst this entente. Ha wonld have been well inspired not to have
                        delivered them. They give to his conduct ao aggressive appearance which is
                        all the more disquieting because his temperament is so ardent, his authority
                        is a'most absolote, his army is eager to fight, and his people are too
                        submissive to reaot against the fantasies and the impulsive spirit of the Cm
                        tar. He may fancy that he is merely indulging in a little lyrio poetry, but
                        it is im- possible for his neighbours to accept this in- terpretation of
                        language directly menacing them. They, too, feel that it is necessary to
                        hold themselves in readiness, for, while de- termined not to attack, they
                        are no less resolved to defend themselves vigorously against attacks of
                        which they might be the object. </p>
                    <p>Like its elder brother Parliament (in the throee of interpellations Ibis

                        tramway system, with the swift-moving little omnibuses, with the
                        independence of oity government in relation to the higher powers, and with
                        Robert, the London policeman. Robert stands for dignity, for British suavity
                        combined with the â€˜â€˜fortiter in re." The visitors note with astonishment
                        the obedience of the oabmsn to the white gloved hand of the man in bine. In
                        Paris they argne with author- ity, and it ia only after epithets are
                        exhausted that the "cooher"deigns too move"higher up." It is a nice command
                        of language that is wanted in the police here, and a real ability to be
                        angry so as to impress the crowd. After Robert, the cabs are the orowniog
                        point of London, if we are to telieve the Paris Coun- cillor. The attenuated
                        "gees" of the Boule- vards make no showing beside the oavalry of the Strand. </p>
                    <p>French doveootea have at last achieved a position of practical utility higher
                        than that of flying matches for fancy prize'. Among the scattered French
                        garrison of the Saharan oases, a dovecote is a permanent part of the
                        equipment, and should telegraphic wires or wireless installation fail, the
                        remotest of the detachments could still commonioate by wing- ed courier with
                        Constantine, Oran, Algiers, as well as with the Moroccan frontier
                        strongholds, and even with Tangier. In case of hostilities, the pigeon post
                        wonld render important service to the flying columr.s. The French North Sea
                        fulling fleet which plies from the Dogger Bank to the Scilly Inlands, is
                        also to be staffed with a pigeon post for daily service, giving infotma-
                        tion of the working resalts and of the state of the orews. The Navy
                        Department is also taking action. </p>
                    <p>The Frenoh League for the Suppression o Dust on Public Roads still continues
                        its la- bours, undiscouraged by the scant measure of practical success which
                        has up to the present attended its operations. The aims of ihs League are
                        essentially humanitarian, and as soch its work was brought to the notice of
                        tho Anti- tubenuIoMs Congress. Still more to familiarise the world with its
                        methods, the League a few days ago conduoted a largo party of foreign
                        jonrnalists, representing every capital in Eu- rope, over some of the worst
                        roads in the Frenoh capital, where they saw tho League's various methods of
                        dusâ€˜-layiog at work. The tests and experiments formed a highly interest-
                        ing series. </p>
                    <p>A great tram formation is contemplated in the telephone system of Paris. The
                        snbjeot has been investigated in great thoroughness and detail by an
                        administrative committee of 30 members, who have drafted a comjlete read-
                        justment of the service. Their scheme involves the adoption of all the most
                        recent scientific improvements. The necessary works will require two years,
                        and will entail an outlay of Â£400,000. One ot the minor improvements to be
                        adopted is an aatomatio central call and ring-off battery. The scheme has
                        been approv- ed by the Government. </p>
                    <p>The monopoly of the tobaoco trade, which is the property of the Government in
                        Franoe, brings in an enormouB revenue to the State, and enables pensions to
                        be given, without trenching on the taxes, to those who have deserved well of
                        their ooontry either in person, or, as ia more frequent, through a father or
                        a husband. The French Minister of Finanoe has just made his annual
                        distribution of the vacant bureaux de tabac, and, as is usually the esse,
                        most of the recipients are womenâ€”widows or daoghters of soldiers, sailors,
                        or civilian offi- cials. Only one man appears in the list, and he is M.
                        Germain, who was formerly the deputy for Lorraine in the German Reichstag,
                        but who now lives in Franoe, and appears to have fallen on evil days. Among
                        the women who have received the envied shops are the grand- daughter and
                        danghter of a deputy, two wi- dows and a daughter of generals, the daughter
                        of a prefect, the widow ofa judge, the daughter ot a Minister
                        Plenipotentiary, and so on. These posts are eagerly sought after, and they
                        enable the Government to provide a means of sub- sistence to widows and
                        orphans by a privileged mode of earning a living. It is a very ingenious
                        scheme, but more suited to French ideas than to ours, as we should think it
                        rather humiliat- ing for the widow of a general or of an ambas- sador to
                        keep a tobacco shop, althoogh we are twitted with being a nation of
                        shopkeepers. </p>
                    <p>The children weep ; Footit is mad. Not to know Footit is to argue that yon do
                        not know the real pleasures of Parisâ€”the Nouveau Cirque, for example.
                        Footit was the down of this establishment for twenty years. Ho has
                        contributed more than any poblio entertainer to the joy of little men and
                        maidens. The oomi- calitiee of Footit have become a legend with "lee enfante

                        this ineffable buffoon. Nature made him funny to look opon ;art made him
                        fannier still. His gestores were amasing, and bis â€œpatter" was replete

                        rame, "Chooolat," which Footit gave him, was in the oat ore of a precious
                        legacy. It is a â–  ame to live up to It immediately appealed to the small
                        patrons of the circos-Tbey knew their Chooolat; be was grateful and
                        comforting, and they ioiiated on having him. </p>
                    <p>Chooolat has passed into the language, not merely as something to eat or
                        drink, but a# expressing the idea of being viotimisei. "J'ai EtE ohooolat"
                        means that yon were badly "taken in,â€ or cruelly dealt with in some
                        manner. The expression arose from the circumstance that Chooolat's mission

                        Daring the twenty years of his professional existence at the circus Footit
                        had one real romance. As a sort cf habit proper to all downs, he threw
                        kisses to the Equestrienne, who jamped through hoops of fire and alighted on
                        the horse's tail with the agility of her race. Bat one day this professional
                        declaration tam- ed into the real thing. Footit became in love. He left the
                        oirons to get over it When he returned, he had a species of triumph. Now he
                        has lost his reason, poor fellow, and is interned at Lisbon, whither he had
                        wandered after his eogsgement had oonolnded in Paris. Chooolat saunters
                        sadly along the Boulevard' saying it is not true. He refases to believe it
                        You will be proud to think that Footit is an English- man. He laboured
                        before M. Loubet or M. DelcassE or anybody fir the Entente, and the â€˜ good
                        understanding" is the motley of the clown. </p>
                    <p>It ia already known that the winei of 1906 will not be anything like in the
                        front rank, bnt the fall results of the French vintage have only just bEen
                        published by the "Moni- tour Vinicole." It appears that the wines are not
                        only poor in quality, bat considerably less in quantity than last year, for
                        the total prodaouon of Franoe and Algeria this aotomn is one thousand
                        million gallons against one thousand fonr hundred million gallons last year.
                        This falling off is doe dm fly to cryptoga- mous diseases and to mildew, the
                        Departments prindpally affected being those in Eastern France. In
                        Menrthe-et-Moselle, Meuse, and the Vosges the vintage has almost completely
                        failed, but in some parts of Franoe the orop is larger than last year, for
                        example, in the Cflte-d'Or, SaOno-et Loire.and Dordogne, where the output
                        shows a considerable increase. Both Algeria and Corsica have fallen off, and
                        it ia safe to Bay that very few brands of 1905 will appear in the wine lists
                        of the fatnre. With nearly three hundred million gallons less wine produce
                        1, and that in large measure of interior quality, the vintage of this antnmn
                        will have to fijnre on the wine card among the cheaper sorts, which are not
                        accorded the honor of a name and a date by the wine- merchants. </p>

                        prevailing in Poplsr, amount- ing to 12s. in the Â£, and now the firmâ€™s
                        machinery is also rated, the harden of the municipal exactions has fco.ome
                        intolerable. Yarrow's will probably go to the North- East, where wares as
                        well are cheaper. â€˜The pnblio ot the North of Bogland,â€ Mr. Yarrow says,
                        "are more frugal and thrifty than in London, and devote less time to
                        pleasore and amusement than is the case here. Con- sequently yon get a
                        better class of em- ployes all roond. The same love of pleasore pervades all
                        dasses of aodety in London, from the highest to the lowest, and the pro-
                        portion of time and study given to pleasure as compared with work, is all on
                        the side of pleamre. There ia not the slightest ohanoe of Yarrow's remaining
                        on the Thames. If the firm do not leave, they say they will go into the
                        bankroptoy oonrt They mean to try the North first. </p>
                    <p>Never, in the most intolerant days, were religions polemics fought out with
                        more bitter- ness th\n are military nowadays. The war of creeds is as
                        nothing to that of the schemes and systems advocated for the perfeotiog of
                        oor institutions. Every ore, since the Sooth Afrioan war, has his own
                        panaces, and derides all others. Failure then was referred to various
                        causes; seldom, if ever, to the right one ; and suggested remedial have been
                        pnt forward for all with no resalt bat increasing confusion and the
                        continual postponement of reform. The truth is that the word reform is a
                        misnomer, and the orying need for it has never been made out explicitly.
                        Once again we must emphasise the real desideratum. We want means, not
                        methods ; the latter will serve, always, if the former are forthoomiog. They
                        were wholly inadequate in the last crisis, and they will assuredly be the
                        same in the next, so long as repeated experiment and increasing obange in
                        machinery are plaoed firat in our requirements. We a*e for e\er asking some-
                        thing new instead of acoepting some plau- sible, even possible, theory and
                        giving it a chanoe. The public, in its restlessness, is like a man
                        perpetually pulling off a ban- dage to look at his wounded leg. Plaster of
                        Paris is the proper treatment, and a period of absolute rest and qnieeoence
                        is most needed. We may not agree with the present Secre- tary of Stateâ€™s
                        pet proposals, and yet jn common fairness let os give them a trial. Just now
                        be is being taken rather unduly to task ; be is taxed with ioaoonracy and
                        mis- leading statement. We decline to believe the results alleged to have
                        been achieved for the new long-servioe enlistment; we soont all hope of
                        obtaining a short-service army. The malcontents may be perfectly right, bnt
                        they have still to prove their case. It is wiser, sorely, to hear what facts
                        are addooed by the authorities in their defence, and wait till we get
                        chapter and verse in the shape of official figures about which there oan be
                        no misunderstanding. </p>

                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
