                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL'S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration.</p>
                    <p>HALL'S DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool,
                        pleasing colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it
                        lends itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing
                        all the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                        dressed in European clothes in a quarry pit Doar the Salt and Soda Company's
                        works at Mex. The corpse was declared both by the caracol apd by the
                        bompital staff to be that of # Sudanese. </p>
                    <p> M. Georges Kanaan, a Syrian pharmacist, whose brother had been missing for
                        some time, obtained an order for the exhumation of the body, which had been
                        buried with the clothes, and identified it as his brother's corpse. How such
                        an appalling mistake could have been made at the caracol, and still more at
                        the hospital, is quite inexplicable. We hope that the anthorities will take
                        up this matter and that inqairies will also be madeas to the cause of M.
                        Kanaan's death. The fact that a gold watch and some keys and papers which

                        found on the corpse makes it highly probable that the unfortunate man was
                        robbed and murdered before being Hang into the quarry pit. </p>

                        p.m., just as the S.S. "Avon" (Captain Lancaster) was about to weigh anchor.
                        The passengers had all been embarked, and as it was lunch-time the steward,
                        J. E. Garnham, went to the galley to see about the meal. He found that the
                        cook, named Johd It Ragby, had not prepared anything, and on asking for
                        explanations he was furiously attack ed by the latter with a large kitchen
                        knife measuring about it feet. The man, who 1 must have been intoxicated,
                        inflicted an ugly gash on the steward's right cheek, and the pair closed
                        together, a terrible struggle taking place, in which the steward received
                        stabs in the head and the right arm. </p>
                    <p> When the pair were separated by persons on board who heard the scuffie, the
                        steward was seen to bave suffered considerably at the hands of the
                        aggressor. He was losing blood freely. 'The captain bandaged up his wounds
                        and finally sent him to the Deaconesses' Hospital, 1 while the infariated
                        cook was taken to the la </p>
                    <p> British Consulate and placed in the lock-up. I | A preliminary enquiry into
                        the circumstances of the case was held by Mr. Gould on Saturday afternoon,
                        when the prisoner was remanded for trial. </p>
                    <p> The 8.8. "Avon" left the harbour at 7.30 p.m. on Saturday. </p>
                    <p> We understand that the wounded steward is doing as well as can be expected.

                        practically unchanged. Owing to the bad position in which she grounded, the

                    <p> Saturday's Gymkhana at the A S.C. grounds was a decided sgocess. The weather
                        was favorable, a cool sea breeze reventing the san from disturbing anybody's
                        comfort. The attendance, considering the date, was very fair, &amp; large
                        number of ladies being present, and the events were keenly contested. The
                        proubnce of quite a strong Cairocontingent added greatly to the interest of
                        the proceedings. Mr. M. de O. Findlay and Mrs. Findlay, the Hon. F. O. Lind.

                        and many other well-known Anglo Egyptians watebed the events, which we
                        describe in detail below: </p>
                    <p> TENT PEGGING.-There were 9 entries for the tent pegging, which was well won
                        by Mr. Simonds, who took all hia pegs in very nice style. Second honors were
                        divided between Messrs. Richmond and Trafford, who took two pegs each. </p>
                    <p> HACK SCURRY.--For bona fide Hacks, 14.1 and under, that have never run in a
                        race at any race meeting in Egypt (Gymkhana szcepted) and do not belong to
                        any racing stable. Catch weights, over 11 st. Distance 3 farlongs. -A field
                        of 16 turned out for this event, which was easily won by Mr. Donaldson's
                        Derry Boy, followed by Mr. Hoyami's Crieri and Mr. Trafford's Port Said. Mr.
                        Donaldson could not draw the 11 st. catch weight by soupe Ibe. and the prize
                        was therefore awarded to Mr. Hogami. </p>
                    <p> WHISTLING COON RACE. - This was the most amusing event of the day. The
                        competitors, after sprigting for 60 yards, lined up in front of their
                        partners, who were posted at the fence beside the judge'e box, and a
                        wonderful combination of melodiee filled the air for halt a minute. The
                        distracting effect of s donen tunes simultaneously whistled and the bad
                        condition of some of the sprinters, whose exertions on foot reduced their
                        whistling powers to a minimum, made identification difficult We are assured
                        that a lady to whom "The British Grenadiers" was whistled, wrote down I the
                        name of the air as "Bill Bailey," and that </p>

                        quickly recognised, and Mrs. Gedge was second, Mr. Hemp'8"Auld Lang Byne"
                        being equally anmistakable. Our con gratulations to the Berksbires on their
                        musical efficiency </p>
                    <p> CIGAR AND UMBRELLA RACE.-Thirteen entries made a big field in this roe. One
                        or two parasole suffered and one of the competitors planted his saddle
                        dangerously near his pony's tail. Mr. Bartlett was first off but dropped the
                        parasol he wielded, and Mr. Richmond came in winner. </p>
                    <p> LADIES' BICYCLE RACE.(lastin wins). Won by Miss E. Allen. Mrs. Kalham was
                        &amp; good second. | POTATO AND BUCKET OOMPETI|TION.---There were 20 entries
                        for this event, but most of the performers seemed rather at ses. Mr.
                        Jenkinson and Mr. Donaldson were finally given an extra run, which was won
                        by the former, who made the best individual run in the event, getting in two
                        potatoes out of three. </p>
                    <p> EGG AND SPOON RACE ON PONIES.This event brought 18 entries, inclading one
                        lady, into the field, and was won by Mr. Hemp. Very few competitors arrived
                        with their eggs unbroken. </p>
                    <p> At the close of the meeting, which did not last too long, Mrs. M. de C.

                        present. The meeting was thoroughly well organised by the A. 8. C. stewards
                        and was greatly enjoyed by all present. The band of the lad Royal Berkshire
                        Regiment played selections of music during the afternoon. </p>

                    "Evening Standanl," it ia the m m who has won tho open championship four times—a
                    record only equalled by the two Morrises, "Old Tom" and "Young Tom." And in this
                    book Harry Vardon shows that he is as jjoi 1 at preaching as at practioo. As an
                    instruc- for be is detailed but lucid. Thoroughly as he goes into the question
                    o( grip, stance, swing, . ■md the correct use of each club, his explana- tions
                    never become involved,and are materially helped out by a numbor of excellent
                    reproduc- tions of the author porforming the strokes cot only in the right but
                    also, by way of awful illustration, in the wrong way. These latter poses, wo
                    hasten to add, Vardon found it "most inconveuient andjdifficalt" to assume. But
                    they wear a fairly familiar look, somehow. Vardon addresses himself to an
                    audience alike of beginners and of proficients. He keeps the "fancy" strokos in
                    a separate cate- gory, howevor. To the boginner he is at the same time
                    encouraging and depressing.' It is never too late to start. Even at forty or
                    forty-five wo can reach scratch or very near it, but—at least three months'
                    persis- tent and laborious practice is a tine qua non. As a shining example ho
                    points to Mr. Balfour as having, it is stated, "spent a miserable fortnight in

                    is interesting Jo hear that in Vardon's opinion the Premier isnowa very good and
                    steady player, and might be still better but for Parliamentary cares. Which is
                    the master stroke in golf 1 That is another very interesting point on which he
                    records his opinion. He awards tho palm to none of the ordinary shots, however
                    perfect 1'he greatest is tho stroke to which a big pull or slice is
                    intentionally applied for the accom- plishment of a specific purpose, which
                    could nut be achieved in any other way.</p>
                <p>"I call it the master shot because, to ac- complish it with any certainty and
                    perfection, it is oo difficult even to the experienced golfer, because it calls
                    for tho most absolute command over the club and every nerve and sinew of the
                    body, and the courageous heart of the true sportsman whom no difficulty may
                    daunt, and because, when properly done, it ia a splendid thing to soo, and for a
                    certainty results in material gain to tho mab who played it" The best course in
                    the world, in Vardon's estimation, is Sandwich. He acknowledges that he is at
                    varianoe here with many of the best authorities on the gamo, but Ire gives good
                    reasons for his choice. Prestwick and Hoy lake be puts next, but his verdict on
                    St Andrews, passed, of course, before the reoent championships, is one of
                    distinctly modified praise. It is "a good oourso generally, but its bunkers are
                    badly placed." And here the author is certainly uot alone in his opinion. lu the
                    lighter portion of his book, which, we must add, is written in really admirable
                    style, Vardon has collected a number of delightful golf auecdot.-, with
                    comparatively few chest- nuts among them. His visit to America in 1900, when he
                    won the American Champion- ship, was notable, among other thing*, for the
                    achievements of the reporters, who, trne to their tradition of sensationalism,
                    announced, one that he "carried away the green with his drive," another that he
                    "dropped dead at the hole." Pacts, however, were as queer as fiction iu some
                    parts of tho trip. On one Florida course men with sticks had to bo kept con-

                    !</p>
                <p>But the best stories are to be found in the chapter "Conoeming Caddies." There
                    was a busy day on/jne occasion at North Berwick, when all the regular caddies
                    were out, and fishermen were drafted into the service. A well known player
                    engaged one of them, though the recruit acknowledged that he only knew very
                    little of the game.</p>
                <p>"This player happened to be left-handed, and took up his etanoe on the first tee
                    aooord- ingly, whereupon the son of the sea at once' adopted tho part of tutor,
                    and with some warmth and show of ooutempt exclaimed loudly, 'I dinna ken much

                    side of the baw! Awa' to . the other side ?' "</p>
                <p>More disconcerting and less amusing (to the player) was the following experience
                    "Two golfers of some Highland eelebritywere playing a match one day at Luff
                    ness, and after a hard round they came to the eighteenth tee all square and but

                    them approached bis master and nervously whispered to him, 'Please sir, wad ye
                    do your very best here, for there's money on this match.' And the goiter did try
                    to do his very best indeed, but he pressed and he foozled, and he lost the hole
                    and the match. Sympathetically he turned to his caddie to ask him what wus the
                    amount of the lost wager that he might pay it for him and soften his
                    disappointment 'It was a penny, sir,' said Use boy."</p>
                <p>Mr. Balfour figures in more than one plea- sant little incident "He has a
                    remarkable memory for the caddies who have served him, and onoe, when on the
                    tee, just about to engage in a foursome, he re- cognised one of his opponents'
                    caddies as a boy who on a former occasion had carried his own clubs, and be

                    to one of bis colleagues fie remarked, 'Ye see boo we Conservatives ken aue
                    anither " But we are inclined to think that the finest illustration of the
                    "humanity" of the club- carfying class is to be fonnd in a story of a famous
                    caddie nazped Sandy Smith. He "am- or,e day carrying for a player who had the
                    good fortune to be no fewer than six holes up on his opponent by the time the
                    eighth hole was reached. At this green something having gone wrong with tho
                    reckoning of the strokes, there was a mild dispute as to whether the hole had
                    been won by Sandy's man or whether it had boon halved. Bventually it was agreed
                    that it was halved, bat as the players moved away to the next tee, he who was
                    six down being ont of earshot in front, his opponent remarked to Sandy, 'You
                    know, Sandy, I still think I won that holo after all.' Sandy seemed shocked at
                    such a cold-blooded greed for holes, und re- provingly, vory seriously, and

                    way of reminiscence and of his observations in great matches. And whatever he
                    has to say he says well. It is a book worthy of a place in the library of every

                <p>In "Country Life in Amerioa," Mr. H.K. Job, an Amerioan naturalist, gives an
                    account, illustrated by photographs, of an egret rookery he discovered in a
                    southern State, unknown to the hnnter and rigorously protected. Ho says :—</p>

                    mud and through immonse salt marshes, found ns anchored at the desired locality.
                    Even before the anchor took the mud, late in the afternoon, I had seen the sun
                    glance on the dazzling whiteness of several dozens of egrets at they flew to and

                    with their delioate needle-foliage of pale green, hung the streaming grey moss.

                    in India seems tOj.mako very slow progress, it has undoubtedly gained ground in
                    some localities. The ryot is, as m rule, conservative in all his tendencies,
                    -and it has been found very difficult to oonvinoe these humble tillers of the

                    paying ten times that rate to some grasping money- lender on the same security.
                    On first estab- lishment, the new institutions are invariably regarded with
                    suspicion and dislike, all manner of libellous stories being disseminated by the
                    pests they seek to supplant In one instance, the ryots were induoed to believe
                    gthat the very latest devioe of the Siroar to disoover the innovation was the
                    hidden taxable resources of the agricultural popu- lation. But the temptation to
                    obtain loans on such comparatively easy oonditions led some of the more
                    enlightened peasants to make trial of the new system, and when no harm resulted
                    to these bold experimentalists, the more timorous embarked in the venture. It is
                    calculated that by fixing the rate of interest as high as 13 per oent adequate
                    provision is made for famine years and their inevitable losses. But that theory
