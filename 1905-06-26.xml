<head>THB STATE RAILWAYS.
FORMATION OF NEW BOARD.</head>
<p>We understand that Major Johnstone, whilst in
England, selected a gentleman, thoroughly expe
rienced in railway matters, who will be appointed
as his special secretary. It is also said that a
new board will be created, consisting of Mus-
tapha Pasha Fehmy, Sir Vinoent Corbett, Sir
William GaitUu, M. Barois, and Scandar Pasha
Fehmy. The duties of the new board will be to
consider and approve of all schemes involving
the expenditure of large sum* of money, and
they will only be called together to consider
such questions. Beyond this, Major Johnstone
and his colleagues will have entire responsi-
bility in the management of the railways, and
we understand that the former’s position will
more resemble that of general manager of
au English railway than it has formerly done,
as was suggested in the report of the Railway
Commission which visited this country.
We publish this information under all reserve
as we have received no official communica-
tion concerning the changes which ate to be
effected, but we believe that our anticipations
will be found to be in the main correct.</p>

<head>SERIOUS STABbING AFFRAY
SHIPS STEWARD ATTACKED</head>
<p>A serious affray took place in Alexandria
harbour on Saturday at abont 1 p.m., just as
tho S.S. "Avon" (Captain Lancaster)'was about
to weigh anchor. The passengers had all beep
embarked, and as it was lunch-timethe steward,
J. E. Garnham, went to the galley to see about
the meal. He found that the cook,.named John
Raghy, had not prepared anything, and on
asking for explanations he was furiously attack-
ed by the Utter with a large kitchen knife
measuring about lj feet. The man, who
must have been intoxicated, inflicted an ugly
gosh on tho steward’s right check, and the
pair closed together, a terrible struggle taking
place, in which the steward received stain in
the head and the right arm.
When the pair were separated by persons on
board who heard the scuffle, the steward was
seen to have suffered considerably at the hands
of the aggressor. He was losing blood freely.
The captain bandaged up his wounds and
finally sent him to the Deaconesses’ Hospital,
while the infuriated cook was taken to the
British Consulate and placed in the lockup.
A preliminary enquiry into the circum-
stances of tho case was held by Mr. Gould on
Saturday afternoon, when the prisoner was
remanded for trial.
The 8.8. "Avon" left the harbour at 7.30
p.m. on Saturday.
We understand that the wounded steward
is doing as well as can be expected.</p>
