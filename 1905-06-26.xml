                    <p>We understand that Major Johnstone, whilst in England, selected a gentleman,
                        thoroughly expeh rienced in railway matters, who will be appointedt as his
                        special secretary. It is also said that a new-board will be created,
                        consisting of Mus- | tapha Pasha Fehmy, Sir Vincent Corbett, Sir William
                        Warstin, M. Barois, and Scandar Pasha Febmy. The daties of the new board
                        will be to consider and approve of all schemes involving the expenditure of
                        large sums of money, and they will only be called together to consider such
                        questions. Beyond this, Major Johnstone and his colleagues will have entire
                        responsibility in the management of the railways, and we understand that the
                        former's position will more resemble that of general manager of an English
                        railway than it has formerly done, as was suggested in the report of the

                        dressed in European clothes in a quarry pit Doar the Salt and Soda Company's
                        works at Mex. The corpse was declared both by the caracol apd by the

                    <p>M. Georges Kanaan, a Syrian pharmacist, whose brother had been missing for

                        buried with the clothes, and identified it as his brother's corpse. How such
                        an appalling mistake could have been made at the caracol, and still more at

                        found on the corpse makes it highly probable that the unfortunate man was
                        robbed and murdered before being Hang into the quarry pit. </p>

                        p.m., just as the S.S. "Avon" (Captain Lancaster) was about to weigh anchor.
                        The passengers had all been embarked, and as it was lunch-time the steward,
                        J. E. Garnham, went to the galley to see about the meal. He found that the
                        cook, named Johd It Ragby, had not prepared anything, and on asking for
                        explanations he was furiously attack ed by the latter with a large kitchen

                        inflicted an ugly gash on the steward's right cheek, and the pair closed
                        together, a terrible struggle taking place, in which the steward received
                        stabs in the head and the right arm. </p>

                    <p>TARDON ON GOLF. if anyone has the right to lay down the law j on goll, nays
                        the "Evening Standanl," it ia the m m who has won tho open championship four
                        times—a record only equalled by the two Morrises, "Old Tom" and "Young Tom."
                        And in this book Harry Vardon shows that he is as jjoi 1 at preaching as at
                        practioo. As an instruc- for be is detailed but lucid. Thoroughly as he goes
                        into the question o( grip, stance, swing, . md the correct use of each club,
                        his explana- tions never become involved,and are materially helped out by a
                        numbor of excellent reproduc- tions of the author porforming the strokes cot
                        only in the right but also, by way of awful illustration, in the wrong way.
                        These latter poses, wo hasten to add, Vardon found it "most inconveuient
                        andjdifficalt" to assume. But they wear a fairly familiar look, somehow.
                        Vardon addresses himself to an audience alike of beginners and of
                        proficients. He keeps the "fancy" strokos in a separate cate- gory, howevor.
                        To the boginner he is at the same time encouraging and depressing.' It is
                        never too late to start. Even at forty or forty-five wo can reach scratch or
                        very near it, but—at least three months' persis- tent and laborious practice
                        is a tine qua non. As a shining example ho points to Mr. Balfour as having,
                        it is stated, "spent a miserable fortnight in bunkers only, learning how to
                        get out of them from every possiblo position." It is interesting Jo hear
                        that in Vardon's opinion the Premier isnowa very good and steady player, and
                        might be still better but for Parliamentary cares. Which is the master
                        stroke in golf 1 That is another very interesting point on which he records
                        his opinion. He awards tho palm to none of the ordinary shots, however
                        perfect 1'he greatest is tho stroke to which a big pull or slice is
                        intentionally applied for the accom- plishment of a specific purpose, which
                        could nut be achieved in any other way.</p>
                    <p>"I call it the master shot because, to ac- complish it with any certainty and
                        perfection, it is oo difficult even to the experienced golfer, because it
                        calls for tho most absolute command over the club and every nerve and sinew
                        of the body, and the courageous heart of the true sportsman whom no
                        difficulty may daunt, and because, when properly done, it ia a splendid
                        thing to soo, and for a certainty results in material gain to tho mab who
                        played it" The best course in the world, in Vardon's estimation, is
                        Sandwich. He acknowledges that he is at varianoe here with many of the best
                        authorities on the gamo, but Ire gives good reasons for his choice.
                        Prestwick and Hoy lake be puts next, but his verdict on St Andrews, passed,
                        of course, before the reoent championships, is one of distinctly modified
                        praise. It is "a good oourso generally, but its bunkers are badly placed."
                        And here the author is certainly uot alone in his opinion. lu the lighter
                        portion of his book, which, we must add, is written in really admirable
                        style, Vardon has collected a number of delightful golf auecdot.-, with
                        comparatively few chest- nuts among them. His visit to America in 1900, when
                        he won the American Champion- ship, was notable, among other thing*, for the
                        achievements of the reporters, who, trne to their tradition of
                        sensationalism, announced, one that he "carried away the green with his
                        drive," another that he "dropped dead at the hole." Pacts, however, were as
                        queer as fiction iu some parts of tho trip. On one Florida course men with
                        sticks had to bo kept con- stantly employed on the greens to keep the
                        locusts ofl the lines of the pntts !</p>
                    <p>But the best stories are to be found in the chapter "Conoeming Caddies."
                        There was a busy day on/jne occasion at North Berwick, when all the regular
                        caddies were out, and fishermen were drafted into the service. A well known
                        player engaged one of them, though the recruit acknowledged that he only
                        knew very little of the game.</p>
                    <p>"This player happened to be left-handed, and took up his etanoe on the first
                        tee aooord- ingly, whereupon the son of the sea at once' adopted tho part of
                        tutor, and with some warmth and show of ooutempt exclaimed loudly, 'I dinna
                        ken much about the game, l-t ye dinna keen a wee bit Mon, ye're stand- ing
                        on the wrong side of the baw! Awa' to . the other side ?' "</p>
                    <p>More disconcerting and less amusing (to the player) was the following
                        experience "Two golfers of some Highland eelebritywere playing a match one
                        day at Luff ness, and after a hard round they came to the eighteenth tee all
                        square and but this one bole to play. At this critical stage of the game the
                        caddie of one of them approached bis master and nervously whispered to him,
                        'Please sir, wad ye do your very best here, for there's money on this
                        match.' And the goiter did try to do his very best indeed, but he pressed
                        and he foozled, and he lost the hole and the match. Sympathetically he
                        turned to his caddie to ask him what wus the amount of the lost wager that
                        he might pay it for him and soften his disappointment 'It was a penny, sir,'
                        said Use boy."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Balfour figures in more than one plea- sant little incident "He has a
                        remarkable memory for the caddies who have served him, and onoe, when on the
                        tee, just about to engage in a foursome, he re- cognised one of his
                        opponents' caddies as a boy who on a former occasion had carried his own
                        clubs, and be nodded to him kindly. Natarally the caddie was immensely
                        pleased, and torn ing to one of bis colleagues fie remarked, 'Ye see boo we
                        Conservatives ken aue anither " But we are inclined to think that the finest
                        illustration of the "humanity" of the club- carfying class is to be fonnd in
                        a story of a famous caddie nazped Sandy Smith. He "am- or,e day carrying for
                        a player who had the good fortune to be no fewer than six holes up<cb n="2"
                        /> on his opponent by the time the eighth hole was reached. At this green
                        something having gone wrong with tho reckoning of the strokes, there was a
                        mild dispute as to whether the hole had been won by Sandy's man or whether
                        it had boon halved. Bventually it was agreed that it was halved, bat as the
                        players moved away to the next tee, he who was six down being ont of earshot
                        in front, his opponent remarked to Sandy, 'You know, Sandy, I still think I
                        won that holo after all.' Sandy seemed shocked at such a cold-blooded greed
                        for holes, und re- provingly, vory seriously, and sharply said to his
                        employer, 'Haud yor tongno, sir; haud yer tongue. Wad ye break the man's
                        heart Vardon has much that is interesting to tell, too, in the way of
                        reminiscence and of his observations in great matches. And whatever he has
                        to say he says well. It is a book worthy of a place in the library of every
                        golfer.</p>
