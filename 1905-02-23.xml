                    <p>M. Raoul Pugno's recital, so long looked for ward to, came to pass last
                        Tuesday before an overflowing audience. Seldom have we seen the large
                        concert-hall of the New Khedivial Hotel so crowded, and by so intelligent
                        and appreciative an audience. Some people be­forehand took exception to the
                        fact that M. Pugno was unassisted by some vocalist, but hardly had this
                        grand performer touched the keyboard than everyone was convinced that the
                        programme of 15 items would be only too quickly finished. M. Pugno is justly
                        consider­ed to have taken the place of Rubinstein in European fame, and yet
                        itseems to us he is unknown in London, whither all the greatest artists
                        congregate. His touch can only be compared in roundness, purity, and
                        distinctness of tone to that of Kubelik, the greatest violinist of the day.
                        For rapidity of finger combined with a limpid clearness—never a slur nor a
                        false note—M. Pugno must be placed quite "hors de ligne." Never has Weber's
                        "Hilarité" been heard given at such a pace, and yet with a perfect
                        enunciation of every note. Power, energy, and dash are all qualities of this
                        great pianist, but for breadth and depth Rubinstein excelled him, if not in
                        correct passage playing and rapidity. Those who can recollect Rubinstein
                        will remember that often in his most inspired moments, when his long hair
                        fell over his cheek and his hands were raised above his head, wrong notes
                        were often forgiven by his enthusiastic admirers, who almost worshipped him.
                        The programme was divided into three parts. The first was dedicated to the
                        older school, and M. Pugno played a most delightful selection from Bach,
                        Handel, and Scarlatti, the pace of Bach's Fugue and Handel's Gavotte being
                        simply marvellous. These three pieces he played without once touching the
                        pedal. He then gave that chef d'œuvre of Beethoven known as the "Moonlight
                        Sonata" to all music lovers,—one that every pupil attempts and usually
                        murders!—On Tuesday night it was a magnificent performance from start to
                        finish. The second part was entirely composed of Chopin's music, and the
                        first, three pieces were oldfavorites, familiar to all amateurs, and
                        therefore an admirable lesson to the Con­servatoire pupils who were grouped
                        at the back and sides of the platform. The Ballade in G Minor was a
                        veritable "tour de force," and the Polonaise which followed in E flat was
                        amazing in its astonishing passages, where both hands seemed to be working
                        in contrary and yet always bringing the composer's ideas to a grand
                        culminating finale. Part III. led off with Weber's Hilarité, already
                        mentioned, and then came two delightful little bits by Grieg. The one on
                        Butterflies we thought wonderfully descriptive, and we heard distinctly the
                        flutter of the fragile wings flapping more slowly when alighting on some
                        winsome flower. M. Puguo then gave us an idea of his own compositions, the
                        second of which we much preferred, the first being more difficult than
                        beautiful. Lizst's XIth. Rhapsodie was a strange exhibition of bis power
                        over the strings of the instrument to produce reverberating echoes, and was
                        more intended to astonish the ordinary concert-goer rather than edify the
                        musician. The wild "gallop for the avenue" was a surprising demonstration of
                        the strength and agility of this wonderful pianist. At the end the audience
                        stood up and clapped and bravoed until he returned to acknowledge the
                        heartiness of his reception in our city.</p>

                    <p>The struggle on the Alexandria Bourse in regard to the Land Bank of Egypt has
                        ended in the triumph of the party of the opposition, who have succeeded in
                        keeping, for the present at all events, the shares of the bank from being
                        officially quoted</p>
                    <p>At Tuesday's general meeting of the Alexandria Stockbrokers Association
                        three-fourths of those present left the meeting as soon as the question of
                        the Land Bank came up for discussion as they objected to voting by a show of
                        hands instead of by a secret ballot. The dissentient were about fifty in
                        number. Only four of those who remained had the courage to formally protest
                        against the admission of the Bank. The remainder, about fifteen, accepted
                        the quotation of the shares by a show of hands.</p>
                    <p>Immediately afterwards Mr. Rossano resigned his position on the committee of
                        the association, as he disagreed with his fellow committeemen, and
                        considered that the meeting had been irregularly composed, and that the
                        proposition to admit the Bank had been irregularly presented as a report
                        ought first to have been made. Yesterday two more important resignations
                        followed, Mr. Alfred Campos vice-president of the association, and Mr.
                        Caralli, another member of the committee having sent in their
                        resignations.</p>
                    <p>The decision, arrived at on Tuesday, was annulled yesterday at the request of

                    <head>ABBAS HELMY THEATRE</head>
                    <p>MIGNON</p>
                    <p>The performance at this theatre last evening of Thomas's Mignon is of
                        especial interest; it is probably unique in the annals of operatic
                        productions in Alexandria, or, for that matter, in Egypt, inasmuch that,
                        included in the cast, were two of the brightest stars of the operatic world,
                        in the persons of Signore Gemma Bellincioni and Isabella Svicher. The
                        exceptional opportunity afforded to the theatre- going public by the
                        enterprising management of this theatre was fully taken advantage of, for
                        the house was crowded in every part and presented an animated appearance,
                        the Governor of Alexandria being among the fashionable audience. The story
                        of Mignon, which is founded on ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship," by
                        Goethe, is too well known to require any mention here, and those who were
                        sufficiently fortunate to be able to witness last night's performance will,
                        we are confident, confirm our statement that a truer or more perfect
                        presentation of this melodious opera would be well-nigh impossible. The
                        pathetic character of Mignon, in the hands of such an accomplished artiste
                        as Bellihcioni, was a creation not easily forgotten ; the great artiste s
                        very presence proves magnetic, and the many charming arias allotted to the
                        rôle were delivered with such a depth of feeling, such tenderness and
                        artistic skill, that moved many to tears, and showed so clearly her delicate
                        imaginative temperament and her exquisite sense of the value of light and
                        shade ; her all consuming, self-effacing art was constantly in evidence.
                        Signora Isabella Svicher's performance in the rôle of Filina proved a
                        revelation to many present, for frequently in productions of Mignon certain
                        difficult passages and arias sung by Filina are entirely eliminated. It is
                        unnecessary to say that last evening the opera was performed in its
                        entirety, and the passages above referred ta were rendered with consummate
                        skill by Signora Svicher, who was vociferously applauded repeatedly. Signora
                        Bellincioni and Signora Svicher were admirably supported by Signor Tomisani,
                        who scored a very distinct success in the rôle of Guglielmo. We have
                        previously witnessed Signor Tomisani in this particular character, but never
                        to better advantage than last evening, when his performance was worthy of
                        the highest commendation, and was greatly appreciated. His sympathetic
                        rendering of the charming romance "Addio Mignon" absolutely "brought down"
                        the house. Signor Baldelli was again eminently successful in Lotario, his
                        splendid voice being heard to great advantage. The other characters were in
                        good hands, Signor Bodini making a sufficiently ferocious Laerte; The
                        production, altogether, was one of the best it has ever been our pleasure to
                        witness. The chorus worked well together, and the orchestra, tinder the able
                        direction of Signor Donizetti, deserves every praise for its excellent
                        performance.</p>

                    <p>The afternoon of the K.S.C. races opened warm and calm, but the inevitable
                        cold wind, with its accompaniment of flying straws and dust, got up at about
                        3 p.m., and rather spoiled the pleasure of those who were watching the
                        sport. Preparations had been made for the arrival of the Duke and Duchess of
                        Connaught, but their Royal Highnesses were unable after all to get to the
                        races, though it is hoped that they will honor Friday's meeting with their
                        presence. Visitors were not very numerous at the races but there were many
                        well-known residents in the grand-stand, among whom Maj.-General Slade,
                        C.B., Mrs. And Miss Slade, Mr. M. de C. Findlay, C.M.G., Mr. Rumbold, Mr.

                    <p>The racing was either very good or uncommonly bad, the horses winning by a
                        head or by ten lengths. The fields ruled small, as did the payments, of the
                        Pari Mutuel. In the first and last races Khalil Pasha Khayat scored
                        victories, and Mr. Karam won the Grand National Steeplechase withSoudfi,
                        well ridden by, Mr. Lockett, though the scratching of three horses out of
                        six deprived the race of much of its interest. Roi de l'Air, in the fourth
                        and Mabrouk, in the fifth race, ran away from the rest, but there could be
                        no greater contrast than that presented by the two horses, Roi dé l'Air
                        being a very pretty Arab while Mabrouk's appearance could not be described
                        as inviting. None the less he showed a rare turn of speed and started very
                        quickly, as did Roi de l'Àir, getting right away from the rest in his first
                        ten strides. The following are the results THE PALACE STAKES. Value L.E. 50,

                        where all the horses except Gamechicken were close together, but on coming
                        into the straight Mahmoud went ahead and the Bard could never quite catch
                        him. Won by 1/2 a length; 3rd was 2 lengths behind. Totalisator paid P.T. 68

                        threw Fenwick, who was luckily not badly hurt. The other horses preserved
                        their positions during the 2nd round, but on coming into the straight Mr.
                        Lockett, riding with great judgement, got Soudfi in by ¼ length. A very

                    <head>INFANT MORTALITY IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>To tee Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir, -- The discussion in your column on this subject led me re-read Mr. Lang
                        Anderson's remarks upon the subject. He says that the increase of population
                        in the Khedive's dominions is far greater than in Europe, and that but for
                        the excessive mortality this country would overflow with population. In
                        making these reflections he does not seem to have taken all the
                        circumstances into account. Egypt is by no means well populated at the
                        present time. There is for instance a vast stretch of territory ranging from
                        the confines of Alexandria to the Tripolitan frontier, which is practically
                        desert though arable, and devoid of population. This was, in Roman times,
                        the granary of Europe. Why might it not be so again with its virgin soil
                        extending downwards several metres? And there is always the Sudan. In an
                        article which appeared but a short time ago in the columns of the "Egyptian
                        Gazette," entitled "Missions to Mohamedans," the writer described the
                        African Sudan as about the size of Europe. Is there not space there for
                        Egypt's surplus population? As regards that portion which is governed
                        jointly by Egypt and England, it appears from Lord Cromer's latest report
                        that the population is under two millions– it was estimated at eight and a
                        half millions before the period of Dervish rule– and his lordship has no
                        hope of any rapid increase. Indeed, so sparse is it, and so great the need
                        of manual labor for its development that he announced his intention of
                        considering the proposal of an American to import American negroes. We need
                        therefore be in no hurry, it seems, to let Egyptian lives be wasted for fear
                        of a glut in the labour market.– I am, etc.,</p>

                    <p>Projet de reglement pour la vente des terrains de la Municipalité
                        d'Alexandrie, arrete par les Co­mites des Finances et du Con­tentieux.</p>
                    <p>1er.— Les terrains de la Municipalité seront catalogués, et un prix
                        dévaluation sera fixé pour chaque lot, par la Commission Muni­cipale, sur la
                        proposition du Comité d'estimation.</p>
                    <p>Dans aucun cas, la vente de ces terrains ne pourra être faite à un prix
                        inférieur à celui fixé par l'évaluation.</p>
                    <p>Ces prix pourront être révisés dans le pre­mier trimestre de chaque
                        année.</p>
                    <p>Art. 2.— Les ventes s'effectueront par voie d'enchères ou de soumissions.</p>
                    <p>Toutefois, si, avant la mise en vente, le Gouvernement veut dans un but
                        d'utilité géné­rale, acquérir un ou plusieurs lots, ils lui seront cédés au
                        prix d'estimation du catalogue.</p>
                    <p>La cession pourra également se faire par voie d'échange.</p>
                    <p>Art. 3.— Les terrains seront vendus tels qu'ils se comportent, avec toutes
                        leurs servitu­des actives et passives, et sans qu'aucun re­cours puisse être
                        exercé, de ce chef, contre la Municipalité.</p>
                    <p>Art. 4.— Le prix d'achat sera payable : Vingt cinq pour cent, comptant et le
                        solde en dix années, par fractions égales, avec intérêts à quatre pour cent
                        par an, payables annuellement, à partir du 5e jour qui suivra
                        l'adjudi­cation.</p>
                    <p>Art. 5.— La mise en vente sera portée à la connaissance du public, au moyen
                        d'avis dans le Journal Officiel, et dans trois journaux d'Alexandrie, au
                        moins. Ces avis seront égale­ment affichés à la Municipalité, au Gouvernorat
                        et à la Bourse Khédiviale ; ils désigneront les lots mis en vente ; ils
                        indiqueront leur numéro au catalogue et leur contenance, ainsi que leur mise
                        à prix, forme de la mise en adjudication, et le jour et l'heure de la
                        séance.</p>
                    <p>Art. 6.— Aucune personne ne pourra vala­blement concourir aux enchères sans
                        avoir effectué au préalable, le versement d'un dépôt du 10 % de la mise à
                        prix.</p>
                    <p>Ce dépôt ne portera aucun intérêt. Il pourra être versé jusqu'au moment de
                        l'ouverture des enchères ou des soumissions.</p>
                    <p>Les enchérisseurs dont les offres n'auront pas été agréées, pourront retirer
                        leurs dépôts dès le lendemain.</p>
                    <p>Art 7. — Toute offre implique, de plein droit, déclaration de connaissance du
                        lot mis en vente, ainsi qu'adhésion au cahier des charges et aux
                        dispositions du présent règlement. Elle devra être pure et simple ; l'offre
                        qui exprime­rait une modalité serait considérée comme non avenue. Elle devra
                        contenir une élection de domicile à Alexandrie, si l'enchérisseur ou
                        sou­missionnaire n'y demeure pas. De même, l'en­chérisseur devenu
                        adjudicataire, devra, s'il cesse de demeurer à Alexandrie, faire et
                        com­muniquer une élection de domicile en la dite ville. Faute de ce faire et
                        dans ces deux hypo­thèses, toute notification sera, de pacte express,
                        valablement faite par la Municipalité, au greffe du tribunal mixte ou
                        indigène d'Alex­andrie, selon la nationalité.</p>
                    <p>Art. 8.— Les acheteurs en commun, quelle que soit la quote-part de chacun
                        d'eux, seront solidaires les uns des autres pour l'exécution de toutes les
                        conditions de l'adjudication, et considérés comme une seule partie
                        contrac­tante.</p>
                    <p>Art. 9.— Les séances d'enchères ou d'ou­verture des soumissions auront lieu à
                        la Muni­cipalité au plus tôt trente jours après la publication des avis.
                        Elles seront présidées par le Vice-Président de la Commission, eu par le
                        Conseiller qui le suppléera, assisté de l'Admi­nistrateur. L'adjudication
                        sera faite au profit du plus offrant ; au cas de plusieurs offres égales, il
                        sera tiré au sort, séance tenante.</p>
                    <p>Art. 10.— Dans les cinq jours qui suivront, l'adjudicataire devra payer lé
                        solde du premier terme, et consigner le montant des droits de
                        transcription.</p>
                    <p>Art. 11.-- Il devra être passé acte authentique des ventes, aux Irais de
                        l'acheteur, dans le mois qui suivra le paiement du solde du 1er terme.</p>
                    <p>Les actes de vente ne pourront être dressés qu'au nom de l'adjudicataire, à
                        moins que celui-ci n'ait déclaré, au moment de la vente, qu'il agissait en
                        qualité de mandataire et qu'il n'ait, en justifiant de cette qualité, fait
                        connaitre le nom de son mandant, dont mention sera faite au procès-verbal
                        d'adjudication.</p>
                    <p>Art. 12.—Les paiements doivent être faits à la Caisse Municipale où les fonds
                        sont porta­bles. Au cas de non paiement exact et intégral du premier terme,
                        dans le délai fixé à l'art 10, la Municipalité aura la faculté soit de
                        considérer la vente comme définitivement résolue de plein droit, sans besoin
                        de mise en demeure, et, en ce cas, le cautionnement deviendra la pro­priété
                        de la Commission, à titre d'indemnité de résiliation d'après la présente
                        clause pénale, soit de remettre le lot en vente, dans les mêmes formes, aux
                        frais et pour compte de l'adjudica­taire, qui sera tenu de la différence
                        d'avec le prix net d'adjudication et ses intérêts à quatre pour cent sur la
                        totalité de ce prix, soit enfin, de poursuivre par les voies ordinaires
                        l'exécu­tion des obligations de l'acheteur et, en ce der­nier cas, l'intérêt
                        de retard courra de plein droit à sa charge au taux de cinq pour cent.</p>
                    <p>Au cas de retard dans le paiement de l'un des dix termes subséquents, dont le
                        montant est également portable à la Caisse Municipale, l'intérêt de retard
                        courra également de plein droit à cinq pour cent, sans préjudice des droits
                        fixés par les art. 413 du Code Civil, et 334 du Code Civil Indigène.</p>
                    <p>Art. 13.— L'Administration consignera le terrain à l'adjudicataire dès le
                        paiement du solde du 1er terme. Les bornes seront aux frais des
                        acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>Les procès-verbaux de consignation seront faits en double, et seront signés
                        par les </p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>adjudicataires ou leurs représentants, ainsi que par les agents chargés de la
                        consignation. Au cas où l'adjudicataire ne se présenterait pas, quoi­que
                        invité, pour recevoir la consignation, le procès-verbal signé par les seuls
                        agents de l'Administration vaudra délivrance définitive et consignation.</p>
                    <p>Art. 14.— Si le mesurage fait lors de la con­signation fait ressortir une
                        différence de conte­nance, soit en plus, soit en moins, avec la con­tenance
                        indiquée sur l'avis de mise en vente, le prix de vente sera augmenté ou
                        diminué proportionnellement à la différence en plus ou en moins.</p>

                    <head>ISLAM IN LONDON.</head>
                    <p>CREEDS AND IMPERIAL FEELING.</p>
                    <p>The Caxton Hall, London, on the 15th inst. did duty for the Mosque which all
                        good Mohamedans hope some day to build in London. It was the day of
                        Id-ai-Ad-ha, the Feast of Sacrifice, and at this season all good Mohamedans
                        turn their thoughts towards Mecca. Here in London there were only two or
                        three gathered together, and they represent­ed many races and nations of the
                        Last, so much so that the address by Mr. Suhraworthy was spoken in English,
                        that it might be understood of all.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Suhraworthy dwelt upon the fact that in the Mohamedan religion Abraham,
                        called upon to slay his son and answering to the call, was the arch-type of
                        sacrifice ; and he impress­ed upon his English hearers that there is far
                        more in common between Christianity and Islam than most Christians dream.
                        The ad­herents of both creeds worship one God, have listened to the same
                        prophets, and have a common history behind them. The legends differ in
                        detail. The Jews, who are descended from Isaac, believe that it was Isaac
                        whom Abraham was called upon to slay ; the Arabs, for a similar reason, take
                        Ishmael as the Lamb of Sacrifice. But the underlying principle is common to
                        both faiths.</p>
                    <p>Self sacrifice is as much a cardinal point of the Mohamedan religion as it is
                        of Christianity. The pilgrimage, in itself, is meant to inculcate the habit
                        of sacrifice. Even to us, with the resources of civilisation, a long journey
                        by rail or ship is a wearisome burden ; to the people of the East it means
                        hardship, danger, and often death. On the long road to Mecca the merchant
                        and the landlord have no wealth of goods or land ; they must compass each
                        day a toilsome march, and at night time in the caravanserais it is a case of
                        first come first served. No power of the purse will procure a better
                        resting-place than the rest if the traveller comes late in the evening. On
                        the desert road, if anywhere in the world, all men are equal.</p>
                    <p>This doctrine of self-sacrifice is so much part of our own religion that to
                        find it insisted upon by the followers of Islam may surprise the majority of
                        men who are accustomed to regard Mohamedanism as something much worse than
                        heresy. And to the rank and file of Christ­ianity it would, perhaps, be a
                        waste of time to attempt to teach the lesson that the differences between
                        Islam and Christianity are in reality differences of degree rather than of
                        kind, and not so very much greater, if they are greater at all the
                        differences between the extreme sects of our own religion that to find it
                        insisted upon by the followers of Islam may surprise the majority of men who
                        are accustomed to regard Mohamedanism as something much worse than heresy.
                        And to the rank and file of Christianity it would, perhaps, be a waste of
                        time to attempt to teach the lesson that the differences between Islam and
                        Christianity are in reality differences of degree rather than of kind, and
                        not so very much greater, if they are greater at all, than differences
                        between the extreme sects of our own faith.</p>
                    <p>Yet, to the more thoughtful student of ethics, it must be apparent that much
                        good can come of the attempt to insist rather Upon the points of agreement
                        than upon the points of difference. We have at this moment over sixty
                        million Mohamedans in the British Empire, and it may be said without offence
                        that Mohamedans have learned toler­ation through contact with British
                        institutions. A Christian can walk freely into any mosque in India ; but he
                        carries his life in his hands if he starts for Mecca.</p>
                    <p>But if the Mohamedans within the Empire have learned toleration from our
                        institutions, we, too, have something to learn in breadth of view and in
                        sympathy. The Pan-Islamic Society is endeavouring to do something towards
                        teaching us that lesson. The work is not easy. because so few people can be
                        brought to listen to argument or dissertation ; yet it is a work that should
                        not be despised. The breaking- down of needless barriers, and the
                        encouragement of those who insist upon the breadth of the Mohamedan faith
                        and its likeness to Christianity, will do more than anything else to
                        strengthen the bonds of the British Empire in the East. (Home paper).</p>

                    <p>Tahta, Feb. 20.</p>
                    <p>Lord and Lady Cromer called at Tahta on the 18th inst. at 4.30 p.m, en route
                        from Nag Hamadi. His lordship's arrival was only noticed when the postal
                        agent was seen going down to the river carrying the mail to his lordship.
                        The Mamour of the Markaz no sooner got wind of the arrival of the
                        distinguished party than he hastened with a police force to be in attendance
                        on them.</p>
                    <p>The Mamour met Lord and Lady Cromer walking on the Nile bank leading to the
                        town. They were good enough to shake hands with him, and showed themselves
                        grateful for his attention. His lordship said that he did not like to be
                        welcomed with any ceremony and asked only for some ghaffirs. Ten ghaffirs
                        were therefore sent down to the river. At 6 p.m. next day, Lord Cromer left
                        for Manfalout.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Machell, Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior arrived here on
                        Wednesday on a tour of inspection. He was accompanied by Mr. Russell and two
                        other Englishmen. They arrived from Assiout by steamer. Mr. Machell spoke
                        with the Mamour on various subjects connected with public security. The
                        Mamour told the Adviser that he was fully satisfied with the new scheme of
                        the Ministry of the Interior, whereby ten ghaffir officers were appointed
                        for Tahta district. The scheme in question has had good results, as when
                        these officers are on their nightly rounds they arrest thieves escaping away
                        with their booty. Mr. Machell went to see the new Markaz buildings, which
                        are nearly finished.</p>
                    <p>For the last three weeks no less than nine serious crimes were committed in
                        this district. One was a case of murder, the rest being chiefly highway
                        robberies, camel thefts, etc,</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN MONEY MARKET</head>
                    <p>THE RECENT HOISTING OF PRICES PREMATURE?</p>
                    <p>"The Financier" remarks :—That things are humming in Egypt may be granted,
                        but there is a distinct tendency to overdo the hoisting of prices. The
                        accounts of the National Bank of Egypt are not due to be published for a
                        month or so, but we have excellent reasons for believing that when they see
                        the light they will contain nothing to justify a quotation of 27 for the £10
                        shares. The fact is, Egyptian progress has, of late, been so remarkable that
                        the public and the market have got a little dazzled by the glare of bright
                        prospects and still brighter possibilities. Anything which would have the
                        effect of adjusting a pair of blue spectacles over the speculative nose, too
                        eager to sniff fat profits, would be highly salu­tary. The National Bank's
                        interest in the Agri­cultural Bank is a factor not to be forgotten, and the
                        latter concern is getting along very comfortably ; but, allowing for all
                        that, prices are too high, and it would be a wholesome thing to have a
                        gentle set-back before they go higher.</p>
                    <p>Respecting the Daira Sanieh, whose shares are also exhibiting a skyward
                        movement, the circumstances are certainly peculiar, and there is perhaps
                        more excuse for the boomlet. Mainly owing to the energetic administration of
                        Sir William Willcock8, the managing director, the whole of the vast domain
                        has been sold at a splendid profit. In October, in accordance with the
                        scheme formulated, the original bonds will be paid off, and the profits
                        accruing on this gigantic land agency business will be divided equally
                        between the Daira Sanieh Company and the Egyptian Government.</p>
                    <p>Now that the head office has been removed from London to Cairo (a very,
                        sensible proceeding no doubt, seeing that practically the whole of the
                        business of the company is carried on in Egypt), the accounts are made up in
                        Cairo. They will, so we are informed, be ready some time in March. They will
                        show that the whole object and purpose of forming the company— that is, the
                        sale of the Daira Sanieh estates on behalf of the Government—has for all
                        practical purposes been already performed. When the time comes for the
                        formal completion of the business in October, little will have to be done
                        but to receive the cash due from about 700 purchasers, hand over half the
                        profit to the Comptrollers, representing the Government, and distribute the
                        other half.</p>
                    <p>For the most part the tenants—the fellaheen now cultivating the Daira Sanieh
                        lands, which are already irrigated, will remain as owners. The inception,
                        development and rea­lisation of this great scheme, which will appreciate the
                        value of the land concerned by mil­lions of pounds sterling, is full of
                        interest to the student of economics, as well as to the financier. The
                        secret of the substantial profits which have been realised can be written in
                        one word—irrigation. The lands are all so situated that irrigation from the
                        Nile is comparatively easy. The system of pumping is simple, and now that
                        the great barrage is finished, ample water will always be available,
                        whatever fluctuation the seasons may bring.</p>
                    <p>Until the accounts of the company are published, or their salient features
                        disclosed, it is, of course, impossible to appraise the value of the
                        company's securities, but the Deferred shares at 143 should not be bought
                        without inside knowledge.</p>

                        commencement of their manufacture, have obtained for themselves such
                        distinctive success in this country. Besides their "pou- drette" manures,
                        which are found to be so highly suitable to all soils and crops without
                        reserve, forming a perfect organic fertiliser, it is noteworthy that this

                        the scientific treatment of all the resi­dues obtained from the Cairo
                        Abattoir, and also the tanneries. This gives an excellent manure at a
                        reasonable price, and is distributed in very large quantities all over the
                        country. Among the landowners patronising the company, we may mention the

                    <head>ARCTOWSKA CONCERT</head>
                    <p>We had the pleasure of hearing Mme. Arctowska on Friday at the Savoy Hotel.
                        The programme consisted wholly of songs—16 items. The interest of it can be
                        judged by the fact that it began with Carissimi and ended with Richard
                        Strauss, and included Grieg, Humperdinck, Schubert, Brahms (to quote only a
                        few). Mme. Arctowska has a most pleasing and thoroughly well-trained voice :
                        at moments it is a little hard in the "forte" effects, but in her pianissimo
                        notes and for general flexibility and sweetness of tone, she was delightful.
                        The "Dustman," by Molloy, she gave almost from start to finish in what we
                        can only call "sordini," thereby transforming a rather commonplace
                        production into a real pleasure. We can hardly hope to criticise the 16
                        details, and so we state our preferences ; the Carissimi had that delightful
                        "finish" which makes that period so attractive; "Polly Willis," by Arne, is
                        a treasure and shows how English music could once upon a time compete with
                        any for its own peculiar vigour and fresh ness; the Grieg ("La Princesse")
                        has all that intimate northern suggestion (at its best) which makes Grieg
                        such a personality in music. "Bergère Légère" (Inconnu) has a touch of
                        Gounod (that of "O ma belle rebelle"), but is quite free from that
                        ecclesiastical eroticism which displeases so many in him. The Strauss, with
                        its curiously dreamy, and highly individual treatment, set one thinking.
                        Strauss is, it seems, setting the musical world "by the ears," and no wonder
                        ; for whatever his "Life of a Hero" may be in its effect, he is at least a
                        new departure, not cowed by reminiscence into commonplace. We need not waste
                        space by reiterating the delight of the Feldeinsamheit and the Schubert
                        Bongs. We repeat that the whole selection and its arrange­ment showed
                        thorough taste and knowledge, and was indeed exceptional ; so often in such
                        concerts one has to be content with two or three good songs and a host of
                        second-rate items. Mme. Arctowska knows how to choose her songs, and how to
                        sing them. M. Valentino was an admirable accompanist ; we hope he will
                        accept the compliment we intend in that we remind our readers of his
                        excellence and brilliance as a soloist on the piano. It was a great pleasure
                        to hear a Bluthner piano, perhaps the one piano exactly suited to the
                        programme and the room. One word as to the latter ; it is indeed hard on the
                        performers to have to accept the accommodation possible in Cairo ; the
                        average room provided in the hotels (much as we love our hotels) is a trial
                        ; resonance is impossible, and the environment is the more trying to the
                        performers. For all that, it was a great treat to hear so interesting a
                        programme so well rendered ; and we tender our compliments and thanks to
                        Madame Arctowska.</p>

                    <head>NEEDED NEW BLOOD.</head>
                    <p>DR. WILLIAMS' PINK PILLS MADE NEW BLOOD. </p>
                    <p>"My daughter came home ill at the end of last year, and day by day she. faded
                        away until I had lost all hope for her," said Mrs. Barr, of Toft-lane, West
                        Rasen, to a reporter of the Lincolnshire Chronicle. "They were dark days for
                        us. My daughter had had medicine enough. What she wanted was new blood. She
                        seemed to have no strength left, and doctors said her illness was Rheumatic
                        Fever and Anaemia. For three weeks she could not turn herself in bed. Then
                        she took Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, and if she had not she would not be here
                        now. After one box she was out of bed."</p>
                    <p>Miss Barr is now the very type of bright, healthy young womanhood, and there
                        is no doubt that without the new blood which Dr. Williams' Pink Pills gave
                        her, she would have sunk into a Decline and died. Women know why they and
                        their daughters need new blood more than men; but men can be Anaemic, too.
                        The weak back, easy fatigue, lack of interest in life, indigestion, and
                        general nervous weak­ness which trouble both men and women, need new blood
                        to cure them, and these pills make new blood. Nerves that need new blood to
                        feed them show their need in Neuralgia, Fits, St. Vitus' Dance, eventually
                        Paralysis, Locomotor Ataxy, and utter breakdown. But Dr. Williams' Pink
                        Pills for Pale People can cure all these things—the genuine pills. It is
                        important to avoid substitutes, and purchasers should take care to see the
