                    <head>EGYPT'S CURSE.</head>
                    <p>The terrible theory of the Parisian scientist, Dr. Sornac, that tuberculosis
                        is due to Egyptian mummies is thus discussed by Dr. Clifton Harby Levy in
                        the pages of an American contemporary : — </p>
                    <p>If Dr. Sorgnac is right the world owe indying hatred to eternal Egypt. He is
                        the first of modern scientists to announce that archaelogical research is
                        responsible for the great White Plague. Perhaps he is right ; but the
                        present state of scientific knowledge is not sufficient to say positively
                        whether bacteria could live so many thousands of years or not. In fact, much
                        that we do know point to the probability of the persistence of disease germs
                        indefinitely. It is generally admitted by scientists that among bacteria are
                        some species that are able to live without free oxygen, without light, and
                        at a relatively high temperature, and this to an extent known among no other
                        group of living beings. </p>
                    <p>It was the genius of Pasteur that proved that microbes, or microbe organisms,
                        can live without any oxygen. He found that oxygen is taken from chemical
                        compounds, constituting the food of the bacteria. It has also been proved
                        that absence of air has a farther effect, it enables the microbes to retain
                        for a long time their power of causing fermentation, of producing poison or
                        of bringing about infection. Experiments by Fajans and Hueppe have shown
                        that cholera cultures retain their viru- lance for weeks, and even months,
                        under an-aerobic conditions after parallel cultures which have been freely
                        exposed to air have since lost their potency. Bunzl-Federn has stated that
                        the same thing is true of the very deadly pneumonia germ—and how much
                        easier, than, it is to conceive of the long preservation of the tuberculosis
                        germ. </p>
                    <p>The tremendous resistance power of bacilli has been proved over and over
                        again by modern experiments. Simple freezing destroys some of the cells, but
                        many withstand this shock. Several endure a still lower temperature than the
                        vegetable forms, surviving for twenty hours at a temperature of 120 degrees.
                        According to recent experiments by Pictet they survive and are able to
                        multiply – being imbedded in frozen oxygen at 213 degrees.</p>
                    <p>Spores of some species are destroyed by hot water and steam only after six
                        hours’ exposure and by steam under pressure at 110 to 120 degrees after half
                        an hour. In a dry condition, some withstand the action of high temperature
                        to 170 degrees.</p>
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    <p>Cholera bacteria vary in their resistances and often exhibit differences of
                        from a few hours to upward of eight months. Authrax, germs and other
                        endospores have been found to be capable of development after remsining in a
                        dry condition for the seemingly impossible period of ten years. This is
                        absolutely demonstrated and gets rally accepted as true by scientific men.
                        Now if it be true that one species of bacilli can live absolutely dried for
                        ten years, and if it be true that no air is required to keep alive some
                        germs, and if it be remembered that mummies were kept in hermetically sealed
                        tombs or chambers for thousands of years, it is not impossible that in
                        preserving the body of their dead the Egyptians at the same time kept
                        alive—or in a state of suspended animation—the germs which caused the death
                        of Pharaohs and their subjects during hundreds of years. It has been stated
                        at various times that seeds of plants buried with mummies have grown when
                        planted, and if this be true how much more probable is it that germs of
                        tuberculosis, far more recent than any plant seed, may survive this long
                        interval and when brought to light and air begin their peruicious activity
                        again. </p>
                    <p>There is another presumption in favor of Dr. Sornac’s theory, and that is the
                        mummies themselves. The mods of embalming called mummifying was one which,
                        while it was intended to preserve the flesh of the dead, undoubtedly could
                        and did preserve any bacilli in the flesh. This is especially true of the
                        Theban mode of mummifying, by which the flesh was so perfectly preserved
                        that it even now yields to the touch and is not the hard, black flesh of
                        Memphian mummies. If the balsams used were so efficacious for the
                        preservation of human flesh it is more than possible that at the same time
                        and unintentionally the genes of the diseases which killed these Egyptians
                        may have been pre served in the same way. We must not forget that the
                        science of bacteriology is a brand-new science, so new in fact, that we have
                        not had the time as yet to test thoroughly the length of time that a dried
                        bacterium may remain in a suspended state of animation. We do know that some
                        of these when dried will survive a period of ten years and then return to
                        activity. It is the preservation for the first year or two that is rather
                        astonishing. </p>
                    <p>If a germ survive ten years there is no reason to believe that this germ
                        remain in the same condition for ten centuries or twenty or thirty centuries
                        under proper conditions. These conditions exist to a nicety in the tombs of
                        Egypt. The bodies had been wrapped in moist linen first, and then, after
                        continued wrapping, deposited in stone sarcophagi or coffins and placed in
                        tombs which were hermetically sealed for ages. The temperature was an even,
                        constant one, and it has been proved in connection with all organic matter
                        that the dry soil of Egypt is a wonderful per- servative. Manuscripts for
                        instance, that would have fallen to pieces when buried in any other soil
                        have been perfectly preserved, and it is little wonder then, if the dried
                        germs of disease have also kept in this manner, especially under the
                        conditions of mummy making and burial. We know now to a certainty that the
                        Egyptians were subject to much the same diseases as modern men of other
                        countries, for the books or Egyptian physicians have been found and
                        deciphered, and it is certain, from the symptoms mentioned and the
                        prescriptions found, that none of our diseases are modern inventions, least
                        of all the great white plague tuberculosis. In fact, some scholars have gone
                        farther and carefully studied those historic plagues visited upon the
                        Egyptians when the Israelites were in Egyptian bondage, as described in the
                        Book if Exodus in the Bible, and they find at least he suggestion that some
                        of our diseases appeared as these plagues. They claim that the last great
                        and awful plague, when “the first born was stricken" even in Pharaoh’s was
                        consumption in its most terrible and rapid form. But whether this was the
                        disease with which the Angel of Death struck down the chosen sons of Egypt
                        or not we know that consumption prevailed in Egypt, and that during the
                        5,000 years that mummifying was practised in Egypt many millions of corpses
                        of those who hid died of consumption most have been preserved, together with
                        the fatal germ. It is not surprising that archaelogists have never thought
                        of the dangers connected with their interesting pursuit for the wonders of
                        be past and besides, in the early part of the nineteenth century, when
                        Egyptian research was stimulated by Napoleon, no one dreamed of the science
                        of bacteriology. For a full century now the museums of the world have
                        coveted and fought for these old and when any have been secured they
                        unrolled them without hesitation, scattering germs buried and preserved for
                        thousands of years to sow the seeds of disease broadcast in Europe and
                        America.</p>
                    <p>This is a varification of the Biblical “visiting the sins of the fathers upon
                        the children" in a new and terrible sense. It is not upon the children, bat
                        upon unborn generations, that this plague has fallen with all its terrors. </p>
                    <p>Scientists can easily suggest methods of slaying the germs lying in the mummy
                        cases the very moment they are opened and before the germ laden wrappings
                        are removed, and in this way scholars and lovers of ancient research may be
                        protected from these unnecessary dangers. It is at least something well
                        worthy of careful study and the exercise of proper precautions.</p>

                    <head>NILE TOURIST TRAFFIC.</head>
                    <head>INTERNATIONAL RIVALRY.</head>
                    <head>KEEN COMPETITION.</head>
                    <p>Three steamship companies under three different flags - American, German, and
                        British —will seek to capture tourist traffic on the River Nile in the
                        coming Winter season. The competition between the rival companies will be
                        very keen, and it is not improbable that a rate war will ensue. </p>
                    <p>For many years Thomas Cook and Son had the monopoly of the Nile passenger
                        traffic until 1896, when the Anglo-American Nile Navigation Company took a
                        hand. The latter com-pany developed last Winter into the Hamburg- American
                        Company, And the German flag will fly over the steamers Puritan and
                        May-flower next season instead of the Stars and Stripes. </p>
                    <p>The "Express” Nile Navigation Company although an Egyptian Company, is to be
                        run on up to-date American lines and has offices in New York. Two new
                        steamers, the Virginian and the America, have been constructed for the
                        company, and it is claimed that they will be the fastest steamers on the
                        Nile. Their average speed upstream will be 12 knots an hour against the
                        current, which runs at 2 1/9 or 3 knots an hour. </p>
                    <p>Nile cruises up to Assouan and back to Cairo occupy three weeks. The
                        "Express” Nile company intends to make the trip in eight days at a cost of
                        $100. One of their special features will be a daily steamer service between
                        Luxor and Assouan, which will avoid the necessity of passengers making the
                        dis- agreeable train journey across the desert. </p>
                    <p>Thomas Cook and Sons do not exhibit any alarm at the prospect of compétition,
                        as they believe that the more advertising and publicity that is given to
                        Egypt the greater will be the tide of tourist traffic. </p>
                    <p>"For years," said the manager of their America tourist department, "we had
                        strong opposition from the Anglo-American Company, and our Nile business
                        exceeded all previous bookings." </p>
                    <p>William Meyer, the New York passenger manager of the Hamburg-American
                        Company, feels confident that their steamers would get their share of the
                        traffic on the Nile. In, addition to the six steamers taken over from the
                        Anglo-American Company, they had built two new vessels, the Germania and the
                        Nubia. Two more vessels of similar type would be ready for the season of
                        1907-08. The German company has also entered into competition with Cooks on
                        land by opening travel bureaus in New York, Chicago, and the principal
                        cities in Europe, as well as erecting hotels in the Holy Land.</p>

                        of the Prince, but to the lack of proper signals on this and other communal
                        railways, which twisting through forests and fields are a positive danger.
                        It concludes by drawing the attention of the Touring Club of France to this

                    <p>Suakin 5th September. The forty days' struggle against the wash- outs came to
                        an end yesterday, and all the damage has now been repaired, so that traffic
                        on the railway, line is resumed once more. There are hopes that there will
                        be no more wash-outs this year; at least not any of considerable importance.
                        Mr. Urquhart, bridge contractor, Suakin- Atbara line, hat moved his masons
                        and stone onttere from Thamiam to Port Sudan lies, where he has commenced
                        excavations and stone quarrying for the bridges of Port Sudan railway line.
                        Mr. Urquhart will complete his bridge contract from Suakin to Atbara in
                        about a month’s time. The question of the extra bridges to be added on to
                        this line to combat next year’s washouts is still under consideration. The
                        Langdale lost, one of her first-class passengers by the name of Mr. Brown,
                        who was bound for Mombassa from England, he having had a sunstroke in the
                        morning of the 28th ult. Two native doctors attended him (there being no
                        European doctor here at the time) and the same night he died. The funeral
                        took place on the morning of the 29th ultc. the Rev. Blackledge reading the
                        funeral service. Another sad death took place from sunstroke. The victim was
                        Mr. Skoufos, chief clerk at the Khédivial Mail Agency, Suakin. He was quite
                        a young man, a little over 20, wel edu- cated and of a good Greek family. He
                        stood over six feet high, and was very much liked by Suakin society. He left
                        for Port Sodan by the S.S. Dakahlieh in a critical condition to be treated
                        by a European doctor there, but it was too late, and be passed away from

                        passenger on board the S.S. Langdale, gave up his visiting Khartoum owing to

                        Denishwai. Its object is to trace the history of similar cases which have
                        occurred in Egypt within the author's recollection, and in this way to show
                        the essentially inequitable basis on which the criminal relations between

                        15,287 were LE 8,602 greater than in 1905, but on the other hand, carpets
                        were LE 4,227 down. Silk fabrics advanced LE 5 049, though the gross returns
                        for 1906 are still LE 10,995 to the bad. </p>

                    <head>England's share.</head>
                    <p>Although, as we have already mentioned, the expansion in Egypt’s import trade
                        during July amounted to LE 276,134, we find that Great Britain only shares
                        in the same to the extent of LE 33,084, our normal of 33.1% thus dropping to
                        11.9% A glance at home country’s figures readily affords an explanation of
                        the above low percentage, for it will be seen that her returns suffered to
                        the extent of LE 9 308 under the combined clearances of coal and Manchester
                        goods. With these two yielding a loss, the chances of an expansion in
                        England’s figures for any particular month can never be very great, and in
                        the present instance had it not been for the support of the metal category,
                        our proportion of the country’s additional trade during July would have been
                        a very small one. The iron trade yielded a net gain of L.E. 32,551 in
                        England’s favor whilst the general metal goods (excluding those of copper,
                        brass, bronze and iron) contributed an increase of L.E. 8,370. Agricultural
                        machinery shipments from Great Britain were heavier by L.E. 6,443. With the
                        above exceptions, the movements on the credit side of England , ledger were
                        practically unimportant, the largest figures being, with one exception,
                        within LE, 3 500 of the returns for 1905. Apart from coal, with a loss of LE
                        11,581 there were no very serions declines in Great Britain’s shipments.
                        Locomotives dropped LE 6,124, rolling stock LE 5,655 and the unclassified
                        cereals LE 6,899.</p>

                    <head>THE REV. PETER RUDOLPH.</head>
                    <p>To The Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette." </p>
                    <p>Sir,- My name has of late come so prominently before the Egyptian public in
                        reference to the Purification of Alexandria that the following additional
                        facts as to my life and work here will undoubtedly be of interest to the
                        public :— My work here has been so successful that I have become part and
                        parole of all nationalities In fact people of all nations, both rich and
                        poor, come and ask for advice, which I most willingly give, regardless of
                        time, cost or trouble. Owing to my work making or oblig-ing me to mix with a
                        very large number of people of different classes of Society, I can meet the
                        demands of one by obliging the necessities of the other. During my visits as
                        well at through the many applicants who came to me to many of whom were
                        blind, who seemed to live in such a miserable existence, continually walking
                        about in the dark by the assistance of others, who always seemed to me to
                        look upon it is a great trial to themselves, (but what most have been the
                        trial of the blind, without the knowledge of our Heavenly Father’s light,
                        miserable, ah ! miserable indeed ! ) I thought of trying to make their life
                        brighter, not only by teaching the blind to read, but by learning them a
                        craft, such as making baskets, chairs, etc. What was necessary was. Asylum
                        and an asylam meant money any way meant work, and I did the work, and the
                        work got the other. I first went to the late lamented Geo. Goussiou, who was
                        an intimate friend of mine and told him what I had in my heart and the
                        fellow feeling I had for the poor suffering blind humanity. I told him
                        starving for food was bad enough, but how much worse most it be to not only
                        be starving bat to be blind as wall which kept yon from relieving your want
                        He saw the need of an Asylum and be said "It needs work and plenty of it,
                        Mr. Rudolph." I volunteered to do the work and we carried it through. We got
                        a Home at Moharrem Bey which need to be Mr. Archer’s house. Through my
                        efforts and Mr. Goussiou’s, money simply flew in. The first bedstead I
                        obtained from a Jewish lady named Mrs. Levick. Mr. Goussiou unfortunately
                        obtained a Director for the Home whom I did not think suitable. I com-
                        plained to Goussiou, but he said the man was all right, money was coming in,
                        and I had only to have patience. Patience I had bat I could not stand that
                        Director, so I resigned and in a very abort time the Home was closed. A year
                        or two after Lord and Lady Meath came here and amongst one of their
                        enquiries was "Have you a Home for the Blind here " When answered in the
                        negative the was recommended to come and see me. Her ladyship did. 1 told
                        her of my former experience with regard to the first Blind Asylum I had
                        founded and the cause or its closing. She was pleased with the work I had
                        done, but said "with your assistance, Mr. Rudolph, we’ll get a second. I
                        introduced her consequently to some of the wealthiest people in Alexandria,
                        amongst whom was Baron Jack de Menasoe. Amongst such wealthy supporters her
                        Ladyship turned her back on me, (although I care little for that, I help the
                        poor in God’s name, not mine). The Home for the blind was founded a second
                        time and her ladyship got the profit of doing it </p>
                    <p>Truly Yours, Peter Rudolph.</p>

                        <p>Sir,—Under the above and similar heading, many articles and letters have
                            appeared in the press, but perhaps the letter most worthy of note is
                            that from the pen of Mr. Knight Foley, who grasps the situation in a
                            sensible manner, inasmuch as the persons who are waging this most
                            unwarrantable war against our "sinning sisters" are probably equally
                            sinful Far better to look for morality at home ; and leave the "sinning
                            sisters" to their Maker, instead of driving them from pillar to post,
                            and to perhaps a worse life, than they are at present leading. Yousbashi
                            Blatt- ner and the Morality Brigade will never stamp it out; far better
                            leave it alone altogether than take up a line of persecution that cannot
                            help but end in absolute failure and discredit to those who are polling
                            the wires. If the Rev. Peter Rudolph has been so many years trying to
                            stamp this evil out, and has not succeeded, sorely it is not much use
                            anyone taking it up where he left off. Apparently his teachings are not
                            live and let live.</p>

                    <p>A correspondent writes:-</p>
                    <p>The "Egyptian Gazette” has rendered a public service by exposing, the
                        absurdly weak reply of Mr. Armour to the "Jungle” exposures and whatever the
                        Egyptian agents of the Chicago packing firm may say, they will find it a
                        hard task to restore public confidence is Mr. Amour’s products. I will
                        conclude with the following extract from a remarkable article in last
                        month’s "Westminster Review," quoted is the "Review of Reviews" :— To make
                        even an approximate approach to the elimination of diseased meat it would be
                        necessary to inspect every animal before being slaughtered and put into
                        quarantine every one that was noticeably unhealthy, and either to keep it
                        under observation until quite well or to kill it and destroy the carcase. It
                        would then be necessary to inspect every animal as it is killed in order to
                        prevent the fraudulent removal of the internal organs. It would then be
                        necessary to examine these organs in detail and to destroy (so for as human
                        food is con- cerned) the bodies of animals whose organs were found
                        unhealthy. And then, when you have done all this and have destroyed
                        thousands of dead bodies which would otherwise have been eaten, you will
                        have no assurance that the animal was not suffering from an early form of
                        one of the most loathsome and mali- gnant diseases the whole time. The
                        writer illustrates his point by referring to the great difficulty that
                        confronts the best medical skill in deciding whether a growth in the richest
                        patient it cancerous or not. How much greater the difficulty in regard to
                        the possible diseases of cattle ! </p>

                    <p>In retaliation for the murder of police and soldiers by the terrorists, the
                        troops sa Siedlce (Poland) began a general massacre of civilians on Saturday
                        evening which was continued yesterday. Hundreds of people bave been killed
                        or wounded. (Retuter)</p>
                    <p>Warsaw, September 10.</p>
                    <p>The scenes of massacre and pillage at Siedlce lasted for 86 hours. Over 60
                        persons were killed and 200 wounded.</p>
                    <p>(Later). The massacre at Siedlce was appalling; 100 persons have been killed
                        and 800 wounded : the Jewish quarter has been looted and resisters were shot
                        down : the Christians avoided having their houses looted by hanging crosses
                        outside : 1,000 persons, chiefly Jewish, bars been arrested and mercilessly
                        beaten. (Reuter)</p>
                    <p>Siedlce, September 10.</p>
                    <p>The terrorists have attacked the troops, who in turn have burned down the
                        Ghetto and killed a hundred persons ; the wounded number 200. (Havas)</p>

                    <p>Mr. Urquhart, the British Vice-Consul here, was attacked by two assailants in
                        the centre of the town. They fired at him and inflicted six wounds, none of
                        which were serious. Mr. Urquhart, who is the manager of big works here, is
                        unpopular owing to his attitude towards the strike. The Government has
                        expressed its regret to the British Embassy, and promised the immediate
                        punishment of the perpetrators of the outrage. (Reuter)</p>

                    <head>ENGLAND AND GERMANY. IMPORTANT STATEMENT BY PRINCE BULOW.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Sidney Whitman, who was recently a guest of Prince Bulow, the German
                        Imperial Chancellor, during the latter’s stay at Nor- derney, contributes to
                        the “Daily Mail" an interesting statement by the Prince as to the Relations
                        between Germany:— “I admit,” said the Prince, "that we have made great
                        strides in shipbuilding; for, like other nations, we require a fleet in
                        proportion to the extent of our commercial internets all over the water. But
                        as a matter of fact, our Navy is still very small in proportion to our
                        overseas commerce – judging their relative dimensions by those of other
                        nations. To argue, however, that Germany thinks of ever competing with
                        England for the mastery of the sea is tantamount to accusing us of wishing
                        to build a railway to the moon, including rolling-stock, sleeping cars, and
                        c. It is sheer nonsense, and I for one deplore that anybody should deem me
                        capable of entertaining such a fantastic idea.” "And yet, fantastic though
                        it be,” I ventured to rejoin, there are people in England who further
                        believe that Germany is endeavoring to checkmate England wherever she can,
                        either in Turkey or China, and, within the last few days, even in the
                        Persian Gulf.” “Yes,” Prince Billow replied, "I am aware of that But what
                        fondation is there for assuming anything beyond that commercial rivalry
                        which is as legitimate as it is universal all the world over I Remember that
                        two years ago a section of the English Press affected to see the hand of
                        Germany behind the recalcitrance of Tibet. What nonsense! "Then, again, the
                        Press agitation in connection with the Bagdad Railway. This project never
                        was and never could be more than a purely commercial undertaking as far as
                        Germany is concerned. We are all commercial rivals in Turkey, and nothing
                        more. All of us are intent on making money in Turkey ; but whereat some try
                        to do so without waiting to give a fair equivalent in return, those Germans
                        who are successful there, at least work for their hire. They work hard and
                        conscientiously, they produce something—see the Anatolian Railway—the German
                        hospitals and schools in Turkey—“hey give a fair return for what they get."
                        With regard to the recent meeting between the German Emperor and the King of
                        England, Prince Billow said: "A deal of what has been written on the subject
                        is doubtless due to its being the hot summer season; the editors of the
                        newspapers are away on their holidays, and those who take their place are
                        naturally anxious to show their zeal. Acute political questions were not
                        disposed at Cronberg, for the simple reason that such do not exist, as
                        between England and Germany. The meeting of the two monarchs marks an
                        auspicions stage on the road to the gradual elimination of misunderstanding
                        between the two countries. The cordial reception given to the King of
                        England was in full accordance with the esteem felt for the sovereign of a
                        great country, as also with the admiration inspired by his statesmanlike
                        qualities.” </p>

                    <p>The Dutch papers print a curious story about telegraph messenger, living at
                        Breda. The man is about fifty years of age now, and has been able, by self
                        study only, to master an unusual number of languages, being able to speak
                        and write in the following tongues – English, French, German, Danish,
                        Spanish, Italian, Arabic, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Sanscrit, besides being
                        able to decipher hieroglyphic and cuneiform inscriptions. Further, he
                        possesses no mean acquaintance with cosmography, astronomy, physios, the
                        history of art, and various other sciences. The report say that this simple
                        man, who spends his long working day by carrying telegrams to their
                        destination, is often consulted by other linguists on varions subtle
                        questions. He is also alleged to possets the rare gifs of writing Greek
                        poems. There is now a movement to find this extraordinary man a career
                        better suited to his capacities than that of postal messenger, and it is
                        meeting with general support. </p>

                    <head>HOTEL TELEPHONES.</head>
                    <p>One hotel in New York city does more phone business, according to a New York
                        paper, than is transected by the exchanges of many towns. The 1,117,648
                        persons at the new Hotel Astor last year, and the 220,196 guests who slept
                        there during the same period of time, are of a class who make much use of
                        the telephone; yet the extent of their patronage is something of a surprise
                        to those who see the figures for the first time. There was a total of 25,000
                        city calls registered at the hotel for the month of April, 1906, and for the
                        same month 2,500 suburban and long: distance calls appear upon the record.
                        Supposing the other months to show similar totals, the aggregate number of
                        calls of all kinds, exclusive of those coming in for the year, would be
                        330,000. The total revenue from telephone use is something like 10,000
                        annually. </p>

                    <p>Captain R Tully, of South Shields, has, states the "Yorkshire Post," received
                        a latter from his brother, Mr. Henry Tully, who has been nearly thirty years
                        in South Africa. Writing from Pietermaritzburg, on July 28, Mr. Tully says
                        :— 'I was very sorry to see that Keir Hardie and several other M.P.s who are
                        in ignorance of the facts have accused the Natal troops of barbarity in
                        connection with this war. They belong to the same sort of people who found
                        bait with the British troops daring the Boer War. As far as the charge of
                        barbarity is con- cerned, the very opposite was the case. The women and
                        children were well taken care of and only the natives who were found in arms
                        against us were killed. "The reason so few prisoners were taken was the
                        atrocities committed on our men by the rebels. Brooks and Brown, of my old
                        corps, the Natal Mounted Police, were most horribly mutilated. In the case
                        of Veal a non-combatant, be must have suffered awful torture. A native
                        witness has confessed to us that the poor fellow was held down while the
                        soles of his feet were cut off. Hi fainted, and when he came to he was made
                        to walk a distance, carrying a heavy load on his head. His right hand was
                        ont off, and he had to salute himself with his dead hand. After that h's
                        eyes were gonged out, and he was dismembered while still living. Can you
                        wonder that the men of McKenzie’s colomn, when they found hit mutilated
                        body, should cry out, "Take no surrender, sir’s Can you imagine anything
                        more horrible than these outrages, or any people in their sane senses taking
                        the part of the Black against their own country people t The Kaffirs who
                        committed these cruelties are mission auction Kaffirs, mind you I "I have
                        these deuils from Colonel Wells and others who were on the field and found
                        the bodies. I only wish all the Anglophobes in the House of Commons would
                        come out here and live among the natives for a short period. They would toon
                        be convinced of their folly.” </p>

                    <head>WHERE MARRIAGE IS REALLY A LOTTERY.</head>
                    <p>Sir J. George Scott, in an article in "Blackwood” on the marriage customs of
                        some parts of India, writes that every years in the Ramai country, about
                        October, a married lottery— a sort of sweethearts' sweep — is held. The
                        names of all the marriageable girls and of the young men of the circle who
                        want to get married are written on slips of paper and thrown into separate
                        earthen pots. From these they are drawn against one another by the local
                        wise man. This simply determines the fact that the Rumsi girl but come out
                        and is ready to be married ; and the youth whose name is drawn against here
                        thereby obtains a particular letter of introduction, with author- ity to
                        make love immediately with what ardour and success he is capable of. </p>

                    <p>Three men, including an English ex-cavalry- an, have spurted from Spokane on
                        8000 mile ride to New York, right across the United States, almost from the
                        Pacific coast to the Atlantic A millionaire ranch and mine owner of Montana
                        named King has offered them £2000 if they can cover the 8000 miles in ninety
                        days. The Englishman is William Tucker, who served for some years in the
                        English cavalry, and afterwards went with Strathcona's House to South
                        Africa. The ride originated in a joke. Reardon, one of the riders, saw Mr.
                        King, who said that he wanted to send a letter to Mr. McClellen, the Mayor
                        of New York. Not hearing the destination of the letter, Reardon offered to
                        take it, and King said laugh- ingly that it would take him more than ninety
                        days. Reardon said that he would do it in less so the match was made. </p>

                    <head>A CO-OPERATIVE DINNER.</head>
                    <p>Three married couples in Birmingham have I succeeded in carrying out
                        satisfactorily for a month a cooperative dinner. At the commencement to
                        minimize the risk of disappoint- ment, each couple wrote down a list of
                        dinners which they did not like, and it was resolved that the precise nature
                        of the bill of I fare should be kept a secret. One of the greatest
                        advantages of the scheme from the wives’ point of view is that it allows
                        each of them two mornings in the week on which they are absolutely free from
                        any of the demmands which the cooking of the midday meal upon the time and

                    <head>THE PRODUCTION OF PAPER.</head>
                    <head>CONSUMPTION OF FORESTS.</head>
                    <p>Prof. R K. Duncan, of Kansas University, in the course of a series of
                        articles contributed ' Harper's Magazine" on "The Wonders of Cellulose,"
                        deals in the September number with the production of paper. He says that if
                        one asked "the man in the street" what paper was made of, be would almost
                        certainly say “rage” but the answer would be absurdly inadequate, for there
                        exists not one thousandth part of the rags that would be necessary. Oar
                        civilization exists largely on paper buis, and in England alone it requires
                        650 mills, producing 30,000 tons a week to fulfil our needs. To feed these,
                        science laid her hand on cellulose which we cannot make, but can only take
                        tram plants. In the plant the cellulose of the cell walls, with the
                        exception of cotton, which is unique, does not stand up pure and free, and
                        uncombined, but exists always encrusted chemically with some other
                        substance. The substance of woody fibre is thus always cellulose X, and the
                        problem of science was either to manufacture paper directly out of cellulose
                        X (lingo cellulose or wood fibre) or te devise some practical method of
                        extracting the X substance from the cellulose, and thus obtain it pore and
                        free for paper. Both methods are practiced today. Paper boxes,
                        wrapping-paper and almost all the newspapers of the land, are made, not of
                        rags, but simply of disintegrated deal boards pounded and mashed and
                        amalgamated into paper. Any one of the Urge London or American daily papers
                        consumers each day folly tan acres of an average forest. Such paper does not
                        last. The wood fibre oat of which it is made is, unlike pore cellulose,
                        acted upon by light and air and water and the organisms of decay. This is
                        bad, bat not wholly bad, for most of the literature appearing on this paper
                        is made as mechanically as the paper itself, and it is fitting that it
                        should be as ephemeral in foot as it is in nature. England, alone, every
                        year, imports some 350,000 tons of this mechanical wood pulp to turn it into
                        paper. She imports also some 200,000 tons of what is called "chemical
                        wood-pulp"—i.e., wood from which the en- crusting Impurities have been
                        chemically removed, and which consists of cellulose almost pure. For
                        chemistry has succeeded in doing this, and it is doubtful whether any
                        chemical discovery of modem times has had a success so spontaneous and so
                        immense in industrial value. </p>

                    <p>President Roosevelt is proceeding with characteristic vigor in his campaign
                        against the English language. He has replied to the chorus of European

                        books will cease in England, and vice versa, and the heart bleeds for the

                        the fate which handed the country over to be absorbed in Prussia That day
                        was the fortieth anniversary of the battle of Langensalza, when the
                        Hanoverian army, utterly outnumbered, was compelled to capitulate. The

                        well-known clergyman in Lorraine and a lecturer on theology at Metz In his
                        will be left explicit instructions that his remains were to be cremated,
                        and, as cremation is not permitted in Lorraine, that his body should be
                        conveyed to the nearest crematorium Maine In Mets the clergy showed their
                        disapproval of the cremation by accompanying the body of their late
                        colleagues only to the railway station, and by declining to wear their usual
                        ecclesiastical ornaments. On arrival at Mains, Herr Schuls’s friends could
                        find no clergyman to attend the cremation. In Prussia cremation is not

                    <p>It is very satisfactory to team that King Alfoso XIII. has signed the decree
                        drawn up by his Ministers reestablishing Civil Marriage in Spain, and doing
                        away with the vexations declarations u to the religion of the contracting
                        parties in a marriage. It was thought that the influence of the Church of
                        Rome, which is so powerful in Madrid, would have forced the young King to
                        sacrifice the Lopes Dominguez Ministry sooner than embark on anti-clerical
