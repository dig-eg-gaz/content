                    <p>Probably owing to the fact that the Japa- nese have burst the bubble of
                        Russian invin- cibility, even the Tsar's only friend does not treat his
                        angust patron with the humility of former years. Mr. Solovief, the Charge
                        d'Af- faires in Montenegro, has been suddenly recalled as the result of a
                        quarrel which he has just had with the Crown Prince Danilo, who does not
                        appear to be as devoted to Russia as his father has always been. The Prince
                        had arranged for a grand official opening of the new buildings of the Italo-
                        Montenegrin Tobacco Monopoly at Podgo- rica, to which everyone was bidden.
                        The day before the fete came the news of the annihilation of the Russian
                        fleet in the battle of the Sea of Japan. In the absence of the Russian
                        Minister, Mr. Solovief telegraphed to the Prince and asked him to put off
                        the festivities, or at any rate to take care that the two battalions of
                        Montenegrin troops at Pod- gorica, who are paid by the Tsar, did not take
                        part. The Prince replied that the fete was a national one, and that
                        regrettable as the Rus- sian disaster was, it could make no difference, as
                        Montenegro was an absolutely independent State. The ceremony took place ;
                        and, what was worse, at the banquet in the evening Prince Danilo made a
                        speech in which he </p>

                        was that Mr. Solovief fell a victim to his zeal, for the Russian Minister no
                        longer carries matters with a high hand in Cettigne.</p>

                        1884-1890, or not, will probably stand by her erstwhile protector from
                        interested motives. Roumania and Turkey are possible foes of the Bulgar and,
                        however admirable the Bulgarian army, he certainty of an attack in the rear
                        and the grave doubt whether Russia could give, my effective aid, during a
                        campaign carried on for the liberation of Macedonia, is cal- culated to
                        impress the advantages of a pacific policy upon the Bulgarian people. In
                        Asia Minor there are rumours of ominous movements of Turkish troops on the
                        frontier of the Transcaucasian Province, when from all accounts something
                        like a civil war is raging between Moslem and Armenian, while the garrisons
                        fire impartially at both factions, but it is hard to believe that the
                        Ottoman Government would venture to attack a great land Power, especially in
                        days when Arabia is ablaze and Syria arming. But Russian prestige has
                        suffered throughout the Turkish dominions, while German prestige has gained
                        correspondingly, and the repre sentations that the Tsar's Government may
                        make on behalf of the Eastern Christians during the next few years are not
                        likely to receive the same nervous attention that was formerly given. The
                        decline of the prestige of Russia must encourage the ardent parti- sans of
                        the Pan-Islamic movement and the ingenious promoters of a "Deutsch
                        Islamitisch" combination in the Near East. It is not sat- irising that even
                        the most liberally minded Eastern Christians showed a tendency to regard the
                        battle of Tsusima and the over- throw of the Russian armies at Mukden as
                        very doubtful blessings. </p>

                    <head>RUSSIAN REFORMERS.</head>
                    <p>The "Standard" has published from its correspondent at Moscow the address
                        adopted by the Zemstvoists last week, which has been likened to the English
                        Grand Re- monstrance. It is a document of the highest historic importance,
                        and constitutes a ter- rible indictment of the Bureaucracy. The manifesto is
                        said to have been drawn up by 172 delegates to the Zemstvos, and 112 repre-
                        sentatives of the municipalities, and as a statement of the views of the
                        constitutional reference will excite great attention abroad as well as at
                        home, though, except through the medium of the foreign papers, it is hardly
                        accessible to home readers. The English trans- lation occupies nearly four
                        columns, but its gist may be compressed into a few words. Its authors point
                        out how responsibility has been evaded by the authorities. The people are
                        still in darkness as to the massacre of Jan- uary 22, "which will take its
                        place in history alongside the night of St. Bartholo- mew." Nobody knows who
                        gave the illegal order to fire upon the defenceless demonstra- tors. The
                        promised investigation has not been made, and it is even permissible to
                        believe that the authors of the crime have been rewarded. One of the
                        conclusions is that it is impossible to believe in the earnest- ness of the
                        Government in carrying out re- forms, for which, says the manifesto, "we can
                        wait no more." In view of the action of the reformers it is not surprising
                        to read in the "Times" that even military circles are much more concerned
                        with politics than with strategy, and that officers are in favor of a
                        Constitution. The "Russ" is cited as authority for the statement that
                        Russians now scarcely look at the war telegrams. The campaign against
                        Bureaucratic tyranny and repression seems to monopolise their attention.

                            <p>The conviction is growing here that peace cannot be concluded by the
                                present Russian Government because it does not feel sufficiently
                                supported by the nation to agree to the cession of territory or the
                                payment of an indemnity, while it is realised that Japan cannot
                                terminate the struggle without one or the other, or both. It is
                                further recognised that Saghalien is lost for ever, thus placing the
                                whole of the Amur under Japanese influence, but the present
                                Government refuses' to admit the logic of events. (Reuter.)</p>

                                a week, as the Japanese conditions are to be so intolerable that

                        <p>On Tuesday a ban- quet was given by the Swiss colony of Alexandria at the
                            Beau-Rivage Hotel, Ramleh, on the occasion of the ninety-first
                            anniversary of the declaration of Swiss independence. Quite 100 members
                            of the colony were present at a most enjoyable function; among them many
                            ladies, and all the proceedings were marked by the utmost cordiality and
                            good humour. The speeches were brief (Republican simplicity extends even
                            to after-dinner oratory in Switzerland) but made up in humour and
                            patriotism for what they lacked in length. M. Jacot and Mr. Karcher's
                            speeches were loudly applauded, and M. Stutz proposed the health of the

                            sketches helped to amuse the company and to recall memories of

                            Swiss Confederation was honored and the company broke up—till next

                        <head>A Little Knowledge, &amp;c.—</head>
                        <p>We cull the following from the All Saints' Church Magazine:- It was Mark
                            Twain who said that he could always speak best upon subjects of which he
                            knew nothing, because he was then entirely unhampered by facts. Of the
                            fact that he is not the only person thus gifted there can be little
                            doubt. In Egypt the subject which seems to illustrate most freely and
                            frequently this propensity in men is that of the Copts. Who are the
                            Copts ? and at once people who are entirely unhampered by fact will
                            seize this opportunity for a display of originality. Recently in Cairo
                            conversation turning upon foreign missions a man expressed himself as
                            follows : "A great many foreign missions are failures, but none so great
                            as the attempt to Christianise the Copts." Needless to say he meant by
                            Copts the Mohamedans in Egypt. But what can surpass the following
                            remarkable statement as to who the Copts are, one made quite recently in
                            Cairo. A. "The Copts; who are the Copts ?" B. "O, don't you know who the
                            Copts are; they are a sect of the Mohamedans, a sort of Buddhist you
                            know!"</p>

                    <p>THE TEUTON'S PROGRESS.</p>
                    <p>The "Globe's" Cairo correspondent writes:— The most sanguine would find it
                        difficult to discover any cause for self-gratulation in the figures of
                        British trade with Egypt during May, published by the Egyptian Customs
                        Administration. Of late the German Press has been conspicuous in glorifying
                        itself upon the expansion of German commerce in Egypt, and no one can deny
                        that there is abundant cause for reasonable elation among the pan- Germanist
                        party, who may at any time seek to transfer to the Nile the tactics that
                        were played within Morocco. German coal is rapidly assuming a foremost place
                        among her ex- ports to Egypt; that is stroke number one against England. A
                        Norddeutscher pas- senger service has been instituted between Marseilles and
                        Alexandria ; that is stroke number two against, France, which for years has
                        enjoyed almost a prescriptive right to the monopoly of Marseilles-Alexandria
                        shipping. In May British exports to Egypt declined in practically every
                        department—or in those rare cases where an increase was recorded, such as in
                        iron, which showed an advance of £6,392, a fall of £9,286 occurred in
                        machinery. The sum of these individual instances is that in the month of
                        increased import trade that May was, namely, a total of £1,533,600
                        representing an addition of£81,730 over 1904, Great Britain alone out of
                        European countries suffered a de- cline, in spite of unusual activity in
                        flour, cotton fabrics, timber, and other leading imports from the Continent.
                        Germany, on the other hand, secured a larger share of Egyptian cus- tom than
                        ever. It is not surprising that in face of these results, Germany should be
                        casting her eyes on the Sudan, so soon as the new railway between the Red
                        Sea and the Nile shall be completed. Such appear to be her intentions as
                        described for us in general terms by one of the commercial journals of
                        Berlin. At the entrance to Egypt, in Alexandria and Port Said; in the
                        capital, Cairo ; at the entrance to the Sudan, namely, in Suakin and
                        Port-Sudan, and in the near future along the Nile itself by the flotilla to
                        be inaugurated by the Hamburg- America Company, Germany has contrived to
                        establish herself unassailably throughout Anglo-Egyptian territory.</p>

                        Ethiopiens, protesting against a statement in the report presented to the
                        general meeting of the New African Company last week. In this report the
                        board of directors speak of the success of their efforts in promot- ing the
                        internationalisation of that railway. The French company declare that it is
                        impos- sible that the French Government should agree to the
                        internationalisation of a line for which France makes such a considerable
                        sacrifice under the law of April 6, 1902. They are sure that the directors
                        of the New African Com- pany have been misinformed, or, rather, have
                        misinterpreted the news respecting the course of the negotiations which they
                        have published at different times. They have erroneously concluded that the
                        admission of a certain number of foreign directors on the board of the
                        railway company signified its complete internationalisa- tion—an
                        interpretation against which the com- pany protest as not being in agreement
                        with the facts, with their own wishes, or with the desires of any of the
                        Governments interested in the present negotiations.</p>

                    <head>MURDER IN THE ATTARIN.</head>
                    <p>A shocking murder was committed at about 1.45 p.m. yesterday in
                        Attarin-street. It ap- pears that an Italian named Riccardo Calendrini had
                        for some days made a butt of a com- patriot, one Nicodemo Abbruzzese, and
                        had frequently passed from jests to insults. While Abbruzzese was passing
                        Calandrini's door yesterday in the company of a woman, the latter called to
                        him "robba vecchia," Abbruzzese returned and asked if the expression was
                        applied to him. Calandrini replied that it was. A quarrel followed, blows
                        followed words, and Abbruzzese suddenly drew a knife and stabbed his
                        persecutor twice in the chest. The injured man took two or three steps
                        towards the Attarin Pharmacy and collapsed into the arms of a passer by who
                        had rushed to his aid. In a few seconds he was dead. The murderer took to
                        flight but went shortly after the occurrence to the Italian Consulate, where
                        he gave himself up and con- fessed his crime.</p>

                        <p>The railway line will be joined at both Railheads on the 12th September,
                            1905, but nothing has been said as to an inaugural ceremony on that day.
                            There is a rumour that a month's salary will be given to all who took
                            part in the building of this railway as a grati- fication to those who
                            have served a year or over, as soon as both ends are joined. The
                            official opening of the Suakin-Atbara line may probably take place later
                            on. The new line from Sallom to Port Sudan will commence in the latter
                            end of September, and will be com- pleted about the beginning of
                            November.</p>

                        <p>A Greek marriage took place at Graham's Point for the first on Friday,

                            Constantino Garofalo, who performed the ceremony, came from Asmara
                            (Erythrea) for the occasion, and the marriage took place at the
                            bridegroom's residence, in one of the railway cottages at Graham's
                            Point. The bride was given away by her brother, Mr. Gerasimo Lorando,
                            assistant workshop foreman, Suakin Railways. The guests were numerous
                            and several Euro- pean families came over by boat from Suakin. Amongst

                    <head>AN EGYPTIAN MINING CONCESSION</head>
                    <p>Last week, in the Chancery Division, London, before Mr. Justice Kekewich, Mr.
                        a Beckett Terrell said he had to apply in the case of Brown v. Haig for an
                        injunction to restrain the defendant from dealing in certain concessions and
                        licences for mining minerals in the Sudan. The case arose out of an agree-
                        ment between the plaintiff and the defendant Haig, made in 1901. The notion
                        was originally commenced by Brown for an account of deal- ings in the
                        concession. Right to the account was denied by the defendant, and the notion
                        was brought on for trial before Mr. Justice Joyce, and an order was made.
                        The suggestion was made that the plaintiff was not a partner with the
                        defendant. It was suggested that the plaintiff claimed profits, but did not
                        admit his liability as a partner. In the action before Mr. Justice Joyce the
                        plaintiff admitted that he was bound to contribute one equal third of the
                        expenditure in connection with the concession, and the Court ordered the
                        matter to be referred to the Official Referee to take an account. The
                        reference was now proceeding. Plaintiff applied to Haig for particulars as
                        to existing concessions, and then came a request from Haig for the whole of
                        the rent of the concession, and defendant said that unless he got that he
                        would sell the concessions for what he could get, but offering at the same
                        time to consider any offer by plaintiff for a lease. Counsel said that
                        plaintiff was now in a position to make a very substantial offer for the
                        concessions if they were offered by tender. He asked his Lordship to say
                        that Haig should not be allowed to sell, as he proposed, and that there
                        should be a direction of the Court that the property should be offered for
                        sale by tender or otherwise.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Terrell said that the difficulty was as to the legal estate- if there was
                        such a thing in a Sudan concession. The concessions stood in the name of the
                        defendant, who was unwilling to pay the rents, and surely he was entitled to
                        step in and save the property. </p>
                    <p>His Lordship laid that be thought the judg- ment was conclusive against the
                        motion, and that it should be dismissed, with costs.</p>

                        <p>Yet another fire has occurred in one of the Baltic Fleet colliers. The
                            S.S. Woglinde, it appears, discovered fire in her after-holds last night
                            while near kil. 54 in the Canal, and telegraphed up for pomps and fire
                            ap- paratus to be ready for her on arrival here. She has just reached
                            Port Said, and on going on board I was informed that numbers of cases of
                            a like nature had occurred among these colliers. It becomes a somewhat
                            serious matter, this procession of ships with fire in their holds. The
                            Woglinde is to be flooded, I hear, as was the Macedonia, which latter is
                            still discharging, though one is inclined to ask the reason why, as she
                            would be doing at least equally well were she to proceed to her

                        <p>Owing to the holiday season coming on, and to the want of any new
                            developments in the Far and Near East, markets remain quite featureless,
                            and offer no new point of interest. A good general tone exists, due to
                            the large amount of support accorded to foreign bonds by the Continent,
                            especially Germany, who is said to have been making large purchases of
                            Japanese bonds through the banking houses in Berlin. </p>
                        <p>Several Continental correspondents, anxious to give a reasonfor the
                            meeting of the Tsar and the Kaiser, have circulated a report that the
                            Kaiser advised the Tsar to continue the war until the Russian forces
                            obtained a victory, but the suggestion meets with no serious credence in
                            Stock Exchange circles. It is the belief there that no change has been
                            made in the instructions given to M. Witte by the Emperor Nicholas at
                            Peterhof.</p>
                        <p>By the time the holidays are out of the way we ought to see a strong
                            revival in stock markets, if for no other reasons than those ex- plained
                            in a leading article which appeared in the London "Times" of the 26th
                            inst. It was there pointed out that the steady increase in the
                            production of gold not only in South Africa, but the world over is
                            gradually begin- ning to make itself felt—just at present in the low
                            price of money, which eventually, in the near future, must mean a
                            depreciation in the value of gold, and consequently a rise in prices all
                            round. This is an axiom, and consequently those traders who have watched
                            the growing of gold are confidently looking for an increased trade with
                            higher prices ruling for some time, which means prosperity all
                            round.</p>

                            1/4 btoh for money and the August account, showing a rise of 11/16 on
                            balance. Japanese bonds rose from 1/4 to 1/2, the new issue closing at 2
                            premium. Russians are steady, It is re- ported from St. Petersburg that

                            banks have invested 50,000,000 roubles in foreign se- curities during
                            recent weeks.</p>
                        <p>In the mining section, South Africans are very dull, Westralians being
                            the only market showing any activity. Egyptian stocks are steady, the
                            firmest point being Bank shares, which hold their prices well. National
                            Bank new shares showed an advance of 1/8 to 7 1/4 premium. Daira Sanieh
                            rose 1/4 to 28 3/8, the Deferred 2 to 182. Mines are quite idle^ and
                            although there has been a little more enquiry for Egyptian mines lately,
                            and some buying of Nile Valleys and United African to lock up, there is
                            little or no change in prices.</p>

                    <p>There was a moderate breeze from the N.W., and the finishes in both classes
                        were very good. The Jenny was leading well in Class I., when her mast
                        carried away and she had to give up. Although the Celtic crossed the line
                        first she was disqualified by the committee on a foul that she had with the
                        Leman at the break- water elbow buoy ; the Leman therefore won the cup.
                        There were not many staarters in Class II. The Laurea had several mishaps,
                        such as carrying away her spinnaker boom in starting and her cross-trees
                        when outside.</p>

                    <head type="sub">Le Parc Quarantenaire de Chatby</head>
                    <p>Eu dépit des protestations de la Municipa lité, le Ministre de l'Intérieur
                        vient de décider que le débarquement des bovidés provenant do pays infectés
                        aura lieu à Cbatby, parce que cette localité a "toujours servi de parc
                        quarantenaire et que le Gouvernement n'a pas d'autre emplacement disponible
                        pour servir au débarquement du bétail en qnestion.'' A ce'a la Municipalité
                        ne trouve rien à répondre et se borne à émettre le vœu que l'affectation do
                        Chatby au débarquement ne soit que provisoire.</p>
                    <p>C'est pour elle le fruit de mille efforts perdu. 11 ne lui aura donc rien
                        servi de débarrasser Cbatby de tous les établissements insalubres, abattoir,
                        parc quarantanaire, lazaret, tanneries, pour les transporter au Mex et
                        ruiner cette localité. Les espérances d'habiles spéculateurs fondées sur une
                        plus-value énorme des terrains se trouvera du même coup anéantie. Et voilà
                        ces excellents propriétaires et conseillers muets, consternés par un
                        événement qu'ils n'ont pas prévu.</p>
                    <p>Cependant le débarquement n'aura pas lien et nous sommes étonnés de voir que
                        dans un collège d'hommes aussi pratiques etseusés que le sont nos édiles il
                        ne se soit pas trouvé un membre pour en montrer l'impossibilité. Le
                        débarquement de bestiaux à Chatby est ma- tériellement impossible. A ce mot
                        les intéressés respirent !</p>
                    <p>En effet, les bestiaux venant des localités contaminées, telles que la Russie
                        et la Macé- doine, devront être, une fois arrivés dans le port, ou
                        transportés par eau ou conduits par terre à Chatby. Par terre, le trajet ne
                        peut avoir lieu, puisqu'il s'agit d'animaux suspects ou malades et qu'il y a
                        danger de contamina- tion. Par eau le débarquement ne peut s'ef- fectuer,
                        attendu que les navires ne peuvent pas accoster au Port-Est ni au-delà de
                        Silsileh. Il ne peut être question de transport en ballon !</p>
                    <p>Ces constatations d'une évidence stupéfiante ont échappé à nos édiles ainsi
                        qu'au Gouvernement. Sans doute Chatby a servi dans le temps de parc à
                        bestiaux, parce qu'il y avait aussi l'abattoir, mais il s'agissait d'animaux
                        venant de l'intérieur du pays et non de localités infectées. Le parc
                        quarantenairo se trouvait près de la douane. Il est vrai qu'à cause de son
                        insuffisance il fallait souvent transporter le surplus par terre au parc de
                        Chatby ; mais qui ne voit le danger d'un pareil transport et l'inu- tilité
                        des mesures prises, si la première d'entre elles, l'isolement, n'est pas
                        observée. A cette époque d'ailleurs ce transport pouvait s'expli- quer par
                        la présence de l'abattoir. Aujourd'hui ce motif n'existe plus.</p>
                    <p>Si le Gouvernement s'obstine à vouloir établir un parc quarantenaire à
                        Chatby, il doit donc nécessairement construire une jetée au Port- Est pour y
                        permettre l'accostage des navires et le débarquement des marchandises. L'a-
                        vantage qu'il procurera ainsi à notre ville com- pensera le domnmge qu'il
                        lui aura causé par la création d'un parc quarantenairo en un point central
                        et dans oe cas nous ne pourrons que l'en féliciter.</p>

                    <p>Cotons.—Le fermete a continue et la cloture du marche pour le Novembre a eu
                        lieu presque au plus haut prix. La matinee dans l'ensemble a ete assez
                        active.</p>
                    <p>La viell recolte a subi une hausse marquee a cause des gros embarquements qui
                        ont effraye un peu le decouvert et pour un bon moment l'aout a ete a 15 7/8;
                        en cloture, pourtant, les realisations ont provoque une legere reaction.</p>

                        general a change et la demande semble meilleure. </p>
                    <p>Fèves.— Marche toujours nul, mais la cote a ete reduite a cause du
                        disponsible.</p>

                    <head>ON THE ISLAND OF IONA.</head>
                    <p>Considerable progress has been made with the restoration of Iona Cathedral,
                        which, along with the other ancient architectural remains on the island, was
                        conveyed, in 1899, by the late Duke of Argyll to trustees of the Church of
                        Scotland. In the deed of gift his grace declared it to be his wish that the
                        cathedral should be re-roofed and restored, so as to ad- mit of its being
                        used for public worship. The choir is now available for divine service, and
                        the opening service was recently held.</p>
                    <p>The celebrated ecclesiastical and other historic remains on the Island of
                        Iona are, in several respects, unique, and the "illustrious island which,"
                        in the familiar words of Dr. Johnson, "was once the luminary of the
                        Caledonian regions" attracts numerous visitors and pious pilgrims from all
                        parts of the world. The island itself has little natural beauty to charm the
                        eye. To many, as to Montalbert, the aspects of nature upon and around Iona—
                        the naked isles, the cloud-capped mountains, the restless ocean, the mists
                        and rains and storms—are all mournful and oppressive. It is but a small
                        speck—bleak, shaggy, and desolate in the wide expanse of the Atlantic. The
                        real interest in Iona, that which every year brings thousands to its shores,
                        lies in its sacred memories ; in the associations with the great missionary
                        whose frail currach of wicker- work and hides grounded on its sands thirteen
                        hundred years and more ago ; the man who, undeterred by hardship and danger,
                        traversed the Hebrides, the Orkneys, and the Northern Highlands of Scotland,
                        diffusing Christianity and civilisation, who here founded the monastic
                        establishment which for centuries was a centre of learning and devotion, and
                        who, on June 9, 597, passed away before the altar in the rude church his
                        hands had helped to build.</p>
                    <p>When Columba was exiled from Ireland in 500, after the battle of Culdreimne,
                        his kinsman, Conall, King of Dalriada, gave him that island of Hy which is
                        now known as Iona, and which was situated on the confines of Pictish and
                        Scotic jurisdiction. A community was formed with Columbia as abbot, and the
                        evangelisation of the Northern Picts was begun. In the performance of their
                        arduous, self-imposed labours Columba and the small company of disciples who
                        had accompanied him from Ireland met with sur- prising success. Converts
                        were made in amazingly large numbers ; hundreds of churches were established
                        throughout the country, and Iona became not only a seat of learning and
                        devotion, but a centre of political influence. And thus we find Columba,
                        when a dispute arose as to the succession to the throne, virtually selecting
                        a monarch for Dalriada— Aidan.</p>
                    <p>For many years after the death of the famous missionary Iona continued to
                        maintain its influential position. But in the chronicle of the affairs of
                        the island given in the Irish annals we find under date 794 the entry :—
                        "Vastatio omnium insularum a gentilibus." It was the first of many
                        disastrous events in the history of Iona. Again and again during the ninth
                        and tenth centuries the monastery was plundered by the Norsemen and its
                        monks put to the sword. Still the island maintained its character as a "holy
                        place." It was long the burial-place of Scottish kings, and even, it is
                        said, of other monarchs, including some from Ireland and from Norway. In the
                        twelfth century a community of Benedictines was founded, and latterly the
                        abbey became a dependency of that of Paisley. Amid all its vicissitudes,
                        however, Iona continued to be held in peculiar esteem and reverence.</p>
                    <p>Every trace of Columba and his immediate successors having been swept away by
                        the Norsemen, the ecclesiastical ruins now stand- ing, although they belong
                        to an early period, are of much later date than those wattle huts which
                        sheltered the saint and his fellow- pioneers. The oldest of the ruins are
                        those of St. Odhrain's Chapel, supposed to have been erected in the eleventh
                        century by Margaret, the devout Queen of Malcolm Canmore, on the site of the
                        humble church in which Columba himself worshipped. It is a small, oblong
                        building, of red granite, with two very small lancet windows, and few traces
                        of ornament. Nothing remains of this chapel but the bare walls. Adjoining,
                        is the ancient burial-place known as the Reilig Odhrain, where lie, accord-
                        ing to tradition, forty-eight Kings of Scotland, four Kings of Ireland,
                        eight Kings of Norway, and a King of France. Most of these art nameless, and
                        there is a good deal of scepticism now regarding the very large number of
                        Roya personages supposed to be buried in Iona although it is beyond question
                        that a goodly number of monarchs and chiefs lie in the Reilig Odhrain. The
                        tombstones are very interesting. Some are six hundred years old and others
                        are believed to be still more ancient.</p>
                    <p>In 1390 Donald of the Isles entrusted the beeping of Iona to Maclean of
                        Duart, and after the Reformation it and the ecclesiastics and other
                        buildings on it became the property of the family of Argyll. In common with
                        other ecclesiastical buildings in Scotland those o Iona suffered a good deal
                        at the time of and subsequent to the Reformation. But they suffered as much
                        from neglect as from actual violence. The late Duke of Argyll, however, took
                        a deep interest in the remains, and for nearly half a century preserved them
                        carefully. It was, avowedly, with a view to secure the permanent protection
                        of buildings of "such great historic interest to the whole Christian world"
                        that be transfered them to a public trust in connection with the Church cf
                        Scotland some time before his death. </p>

                    <head>THE WAR</head>
                    <head>THE ISLAND OF SAGHALIEN.</head>
                    <p>On the 18th of June an Osaka vernacular journal was able to publish in
                        Japanese a complete map of the Island of Saghalien on the comparatively
                        large scale of 40 miles to the inch, setting forth the name and situation of
                        every fishing village along the coast, and, as far as practicable, every
                        inhabited spot in the interior of the island. According to the Japanese
                        geographers' calculations the length is 670 miles from north to south, the
                        width varying from 17 miles at the narrowest part to 105 miles at the
                        broadest, the total area being only about one half that which it is usually
                        computed to be. It actually amounts to 20,560 square miles, or about
                        one-sixth of the area of the British Isles, and the popula- tion is 33,000,
                        of whom 29,000 are of Russian origin. This leaves us with about 4,000 as the
                        actual numbers of the Ainu or Ghilyak aborigines. The only practicable roads
                        are two in number, one of which, starting from Korsa- kovsk, traverses the
                        central portion of the island as far north as Addaima, and the other runs
                        from the Seltonai mines, following the coast of the Golf of Tartary, through
                        Alexandrovsk, to Pogobi, where the strait between Saghalien and the mainland
                        of Asia is only some eight miles wide. The ferry at this gap famishes the
                        means of communica- tion with the continent, and here also is the submarine
                        telegraph. In the first case the road is nearly as long as that from London
                        to Edin- burgh ; in the second, the places named are about half that
                        distance apart. Alexandrovsk is connected by a short line of railway with
                        Uedelnikovsk, about half way to Rikovskoe, which is a place on the hills
                        some sixty miles from the seaport of Alexandrovsk. The railroad was probably
                        designed to connect the port with Rikovskoe, which is of some importance.
                        Under Russian administration the island seems to have been divided into
                        three districts, the bisecting line running north and south through the
                        mountainous region in the centre to about the fiftieth parallel of latitude,
                        the whole of the land south of that parallel forming the third division. The
                        southern portion was nam- ed the Korsakovsk district, that to the north-
                        east the Chimovsk region, and that to the north-west the Alexandrovsk
                        division. Mouka, of which the Japanese had obtained possession last Friday,
                        is twenty miles to the north of the port of Alexandrovsk, and there was
                        nothing left to capture save the town of that name itself, which is the most
                        important on the island. It has a lighthouse at the entrance of its harbour,
                        the only other light being that on Cape Notoro in La Perouse Strait, at the
                        extreme southern point of Saghalien. One is badly needed at Telpenia Cape,
                        which forms the eastern pro- montory of the East or Telpenia Bay to the
                        northward of Aniwa Bay, in which stands Korsakovsk. North of Pogobi the
                        island is uninhabited, and covered with dense forest for a hundred and fifty
                        miles. The principal fight- ing was done at Davlin, which is about fifty
                        miles south-east of the port of Alexandrovsk. A large river flows from the
                        northward into Telpenia Bay, and the available road is parallel to the
                        course of this stream for a little over one hundred miles, until Davlin is
                        reached.</p>
                    <p>The Amur Expedition.</p>
                    <p>The River Amur debouches into the Hei- Lung-Wan, or Bay of the Black Dragon,
                        togive it the correct Chinese title, bat it is named Amur Gulf on foreign
                        charts. Immediately north of Hei-Lung-Wan is Savarin Bay, where Japanese
                        warships are reported to be gather- ing, and the inference is that an
                        expedition is in contemplation the details of which it would not be prudent
                        at present to disclose. From the mouth of the Amur to Khabarovka the
                        distance up stream is roughly 450 miles, and it is close upon 500 miles more
                        up the Sun- gari to Kharbin. Vessels of large size can get up to Khabarovka
                        and those of smaller ton- nage can ascend the tributary the whole way to
                        Kharbio, and even beyond. There is nothing impracticable, it may be urged,
                        in armed vessels and transports making their way up river to Khabarovka, and
                        barges and lighters might be towed by specially suitable tugboats or other
                        steamers the remainder of the dis- tance, and though it would be slow work
                        against the current the chances are that the entire journey by water could
                        be accomplish- ed in a fortnight. It is not impossible, therefore, that when
                        the conference meets in Washington there may be a somewhat altered situation
                        to discuss and to serve as the basis of consideration, if the preliminaries
                        to negotia- tion should by that time have been fully ar- ranged. So far
                        there is a lingering suspicion in men's minds that though the Japanese
                        pleni- potentiaries are undoubtedly armed with the powers which the term
                        signifies, it may be found at the last moment that Russia has not been
                        equally careful to avoid the inevitable de- lay which would ensue should it
                        turn out that her representative is a plenipotentiary only in name. If the
                        riverine expedition to Kharbin which, it is suggested, may be in contompla-
                        tion should actually have been determined upon, the present is undoubtedly
                        the most favorable, and almost the only season for its accomplishment. The
                        Ussuri is navigable to a point near Lake Hinka, as well as the Sungari to
                        Kharbin, for vessels of light draught, and the waterways are certain to be
                        utilised this summer to very great advantage by the Japanese Army, even if
                        it should not be deem- ed expedient to attempt the colossal under taking
                        here foreshadowed. In Japan there has been a fairly general comprehension of
                        the plan of campaign, though little or nothing has appeared in the public
                        press which would be likely to convey an inkling of it to the other side.
                        The map of Saghalien, moreover, was not issued until the expedition was
                        about to start, and it then gave to the readers of the war news throughout
                        the country an idea of the natural difficulties with which the troops were
                        likely to meet in traversing the island.</p>

                    <head>BLOCKADE OF LONDON.</head>
                    <head>BY A BLOCKADE RUNNER</head>
                    <p>"Where do you think you're going to ? the policeman inquired. "'Eaven knows,"
                        said the cabman, piously, "Bout a 'our ago I 'oped I was goin' to
                        Charin'-cross. But I see as that won't be in this life." "Ah !" says the
                        police- man, "you'd better be thinking about the next life, you had." The
                        cabman answered, and his answer was humorous but wholly unfit for
                        publication. There was plenty of leisure for repartee. The cab, the cabman,
                        and I, toge- ther with many other cabs, many other cab- men, and some solid
                        columns of 'buses, were waiting for each other to pass at the point where
                        Tottenham court road and Charing-cross- road meet Oxford-street. It is an
                        interesting spot for those people whom police-cunrt reports describe as
                        "gentlemen." Anyone who gets his living without working for it will find
                        that corner a most amusing lounge. One of the two great streams of London's
                        East and West traffic flows—or rather tries to flow—by ; another great
                        stream between North and South , cuts across it at right-angles ; and there
                        are half a dozen subsidiary streams which do not wish to flow straight, but
                        to turn in among the others from West, or similar disturbing directions.</p>
                    <p>There are few busier crossings in London. That no doubt is why it was seized
                        upon by the miscreants who blockade London for a permanent fortification.
                        Redoubts and earth- works have been at the top of Charing-cross- road so
                        long that, as the lawyers say, the "memory of man runneth not to the
                        contrary." Aged men relate with quavering voices that the original pretext
                        for excavation was the making of underground lavatories. It may be so. At
                        least, coyly sheltering under the shadow of the present fortifications, you
                        find such places existing. But they are finished, and the excavation is not.
                        No serious man supposes that it ever will be. The present pretext is
                        understood to be the construction of a tube railway. When that is finished
                        of course the road will want repaving, and then it will be time for the gas
                        and water and electric light companion to have a turn—not simultaneously,
                        but one after the other. But they will not be wanted just yet. The present
                        fortifications are very strong. There are two large excavations some yards
                        apart, each with a crane of its own. Small protecting trenches have been dug
                        irregularly. To prevent the traffic approaching too close to the outer wall
                        of the main excava- tion the asphalt of half the roadway has been picked up.
                        This last device could only have sprung from an acute mind, for it causes
                        the maximum amount of public inconvenience at the smallest cost in labour.
                        The result put briefly is profanity. Policemen, good, well- meaning
                        policemen, wander helplessly in and out of the traffic asking the drivers of
                        vehicles where they want to go to, and making things as pleasant as
                        possible. But it is not possible to be very pleasant when you know your
                        train is puffing gaily out of Charing-cross, and you are at the wrong end of
                        Charing cross-road.</p>
                    <p>My horse woke up and my cab slid across at last and we broke into a sprint.
                        Cabby meant to show what be and the "old 'oss" could do, and I, who knew
                        that whatever they did would make no difference to me, began to become
                        philosophical. I must own that I expected a clear run to Shaftesbury-
                        avenue. But "'tis all a cheat" ; 200 yards on there is a trench dug half-way
                        or more across the road. Two drays and a baker's hand-cart block the clear
                        space. The "old 'oss" slides along on his haunches and cabby swears, and I
                        daresay the horse does too, and we all survey the trench. It is very neatly
                        dug and railed in, but quite, quite forlorn. Nobody is attending to it
                        Nobody but the "old 'oss" is anywhere near it. It has just grown there.
                        "Gentle shepherd, tell me why ?" You would suppose that a trench would not
                        be dug without some object; that, having been dug, it would be used. Not so.
                        It is left to mature. I begin to believe that there is a society of
                        miscreants who go out and make excavations and earthworks simply to blockade
                        London. They dig a trench and rail it in and go out of town. Six months
                        afterwards the local borough council hears of it and accuses the Water Board
                        and the gas company and the electric light company, and they wrangle over it
                        for six months more. Then some weak official, much badger- ed, begins to
                        think that it most be a hole he made and forgot. So he sends out two men and
                        a barrow and they take two years filling it in.</p>
                    <p>By the time I had elaborated that explana- tion we were moving again. Of
                        other trenches beginning to protrude from side streets I caught glimpses.
                        But they hindered us not. In one wild rash we came as far as the National
                        Portrait Gallery. There a thick, yellow, un- savoury smoke loaded the air,
                        though which I saw some men at dinger. They were repaving half the roadway.
                        I do not complain of their being at dinner. Any man who could eat in that
                        smoke deserves honor. Cabby and the horse and I were snorting and sneezing
                        and quite still. Half the road was "up." In the other half several flying
                        columns, each with a base of supplies, were making reconnaissances into the
                        drains. Between the drains and the tar-boilers a thin stream of traffic came
                        slowly. Very, very slowly. There was an inspector of policemen wandering
                        about, fingering his white gloves and looking homesick. He might as well
                        have been at home. You cannot empty a reservoir through the neck of a
                        pint-bottle with any speed, even if you are an inspector of police in white
                        gloves.</p>
                    <p>Some time afterwards a porter woke me up and said that we were at
                        Charing-cross. The shock was severe. Cabby looked at me, sorrow- fully, as I
                        paid him. It was like parting from an old friend. On the platform I found
                        one who should have been with me in the train that</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>was far away. "You missed it, too ?" I inquired, with some satisfaction. He
                        glared, "Waterloo-place is up," said he. "And so is——." And then I said
                        hastily we would have lunch. "I've got here," said he, "and I'm not going to
                        try to get anywhere else to-day." It seemed unlikely that we should get
                        anywhere if we did try. We launched at the station. And we agreed that the
                        Commission on London Traffic had omitted the only satisfactory means of
                        locomotion from their report. Walking is the healthiest, safest, and by far
                        the speediest method.</p>

                    <head>GENERAL SIR MONTAGU GERARD.</head>
                    <p>A Reuter telegram from St. Petersburg, dated July 27, says "General Sir
                        Montagu Gerard, of the Indian Army, who has been attached to the Russian
                        forces in Manchuria, has died of pneumonia at Irkutsk on his way home from
                        Kharbin. He had been suffer- ing from an affection of the kidneys and
                        pleuro-pneumonia, and had been only a few days at Irkutsk, whither he had
                        been conveyed by hospital train."</p>
                    <p>Sir Montagu Gerard was the second son of the late Mr. Archibald Gerard, of
                        Rock- soles, Lanarkshire, by his marriage with Euphemia Erskine, eldest
                        daughter and co heir of Sir John Robison, K.H. He was born in 1842 and
                        educated at Stonyhurst, on the Continent, and at the Woolwich Academy. His
                        elder brother is Father Gerard, S.J., of the Farm-street community, while
                        two of his sisters (one of whom, Mme. de Laszowski, died recently) became
                        well-known authors. Sir Montagu married, in 1888, Helen, young- est daughter
                        of the late Sir Edward Meade, of Hill-street, Berkeley-square, by whom he
                        leaves a son. He was the author of "Leaves from the diary of a soldier and
                        sportsman," published in 1903.</p>
                    <p>On April 19, 1864, he was gazetted to the Royal Artillery as a lieutenant.
                        His first war service was in the Abyssinian expedition, 1867-68, for which
                        he was mentioned in despatches and received the medal. In 1870 he joined the
                        Bengal Staff corps as lieutenant, becoming captain in 1876. He served as

                    <head>A WELL-KNOWN ALPINE CLIMBER.</head>
                    <p>Francois Joseph Devouassoud, who died, at the age of 78, at his home near
                        Chamonix, after a short illness, on July 20, was among the best known of the
                        guides who accompanied the earlier Alpine climbers and explorers in their
                        conquests and discoveries. A born ice- man and pathfinder, he had few equals
                        on a difficult glacier, and his courage in meeting danger was equalled by
                        his skill in avoiding it. In the early sixties he wandered widely in the
                        Central and Eastern Alps with Mr. V. F. Tuckett aDd Mr. Douglas Freshfield.
                        In later years, with them or other climbers (the Rev. H. B. George, Messrs.
                        W. and Arthur Sidgwick, Mr. J. H. Wainewright), he visited almost every
                        Alpine district and climb- ed innumerable new peaks and passes. As a
                        traveller he was pre-eminent among Alpine guides. In 1868, and again in
                        1887, he was in the Caucasus ; he took part in the first ascents of Kastek,
                        Elbruz, and Tetnuld ; he had climbed in the Pyrenees, the Abruzzi, Corsica,
                        and the Algerian Atlas; he had visited Spain, Egypt, Syria, and Armenia. In
                        early life be had been a schoolmaster, and his natural intelligence, many
                        experiences, and varied reading, combined with a singularly modest,
                        charming, and loyal character, made him as much valued as a companion as he
                        was trusted as a guide. He remained the intimate friend of all his old
                        employers, and his memory will be long cherished in the Alpine Club and in
                        many English households. A few yews ago he was presented with a medal by the
                        French Alpine club for his services as an explorer. </p>
