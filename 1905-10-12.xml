                        <head>Asiatic Boycotts.</head>
                        <p>Latest advices from India report that the agitation aroused by the
                            ordinance regarding the partition of Bengal is growing in intens- ity.
                            Following the example of the Chinese, who have recently emerged with
                            success from their boycott of American goods, the Bengalis and
                            especially the student class, have declared a boycott of British goods
                            which, if the information given to the British Press is correct, has
                            assumed rather dangerous proportions. Numbers of the lower classes have
                            joined the students in assaulting or in- sulting persons suspected of
                            buying British goods in defiance of the interdior which has been
                            supported by a section of the priestly caste, and the police, after
                            quietly watching the growth of the movement, have been at last compelled
                            to intervene to protect Euro- peans and natives from assault. IT is
                            impos- sible to say as yet whether the movement is purely Bengali and,
                            from the religious side, Hindu or whether it has combined the various
                            races and religions of the great province in an anti-governmental
                            agitation. So far as we can judge its leaders are Hindus by religion and
                            Bengalis by race. The presi- dent-elect of the Indian National Congress,
                            the Hon. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, K.C.I.E., a Hindu of considerable
                            eminence, has lent the weight of his support to the agitation and
                            intends to put the views of the Bengali union- ists beore the British
                            public, before returning to Benares for the next Congress. We imagine
                            that he and the leaders of the movement are sincere in their belief that
                            the partition of the province is contrary to the interests of its people
                            and are by no means anxious to provoke the Anglo-Indian government to
                            drastic measures. If our assumption is correct, the leaders of teh
                            Bengalis should lose no time in disavowing and stopping the circula-
                            tion of the broadsheets in Eastern Bengal and Assam, of which the
                            following example is published in a London contemporary :-desunt multa -
                            no doubt because the language of the enthusiastic babu was not entirely
                            fit for publication, an explanation which will com- mend itself to all
                            who have followed Press libel actions among the natives of Egypt: "We
                            have no king. We need not be in so much distress if we had a king. We
                            have made a mistake by calling a cruel, heartless, deceital, lying
                            nation our king... Let us see if we cannot get redress. It is by our
                            money that they are getting fat. It is out blood they are sucking. They
                            why should we submit. These sons of swine, finding Hindus and Mohamdeans
                            in union, have made a rule that priests for Hindus, maulvis for Mohame-
                            dans, and headmen for Sikhs will be appointed to create disturbances,..
                            Brothers, Hindus, and Mohamedans, that race of demons has come across
                            the seven seas and thirteen rivers, and is dishonouring our dear golden
                            mother, Bengal. Why not take up the club and preserve the mother's
                            honour!" These publica- tions are far more likely to stir up riots and
                            collisions with the military and police, and to provoke severe
                            disiplinary measures on the part of the Indian Government, than to
                            encourage the British and Anglo-Indian public to accord a fair bearing
                            to the arguments of the leading opponents of the partition of the
                            province.</p>

                                American life insurance companies, Mr. McCurdy, President of the New
                                York Mutual, stated that his salary was £30,000 per annum. He also
                                gave explanations showing that large sums were drawn from a company
                                with which he has business relations, by members of his family. </p>
                            <p>Mr. Qjyphant, Chairman of the Expenditure Committee of the Mutual
                                Life, stated that the company maintained a confidential fund for
                                legal expenses, of which the total amounts are only known to the
                                trustees. Mr. Gillette, the Vice-President of the company, testified
                                that the solicitor of the company could get £5,000 whenever he
                                pleased, without disclosing the destination of the money. Mr.
                                Gillette men- tioned that the company contributed £8,000 to the
                                Republican Campaign Fund in 1904. (Reuter)</p>

                            It is an American Egyptologist, Dr. Zimmerman, staying in Paris, who has
                            made this discovery. But he has made it un- der painful circumstances.
                            He arrived a few days ago with numerous packing cases cram- med full of
                            valuable medals, rings, coins, and dainty if minute objects of art
                            gathered among the tombs of the Pyramids. One day he was away from the
                            room for some hours, and real0 used with amazement on his return that
                            all his precious memorials of the Pharaohs had vanished. One man has
                            been arrested with a few of the stolen objects in his possession, but of

                    <p>As we briefly mentioned in our issue of yesterday, the hearing of the motion
                        brought by the Egyptian Government to set aside the opposition made by the
                        Princes of the late Khedive Ismail’s family to the payment by the Daria
                        Sanieh Company of nearly $2,000,000 to be made on the 16th inst., took place
                        at the Cairo Mixed Tribunals, Judge Somerville Tuck sitting in Chambers
                        (audience de Refere).</p>
                    <p>Melter Molten, avocat du Contentieux, appeared for the Government and, after
                        ex- plaining the claims brought by the Princes against the Government, moved
                        that the inhibi- ion contained in their citation be removed, as being
                        neither made in virtue of a deed proving a legal claim nor sanctioned by the
                        authorization of the judge. He quoted numerous precedents to show that a
                        judge in Chambers had jaris- diction to remove an illegal obstacle, such as
                        the inhibition. </p>
                    <p>Matter Carton de Wiart, representing the Daria Sanieh Company, replied to the
                        Princes’ advocate and supported the Government’s motion. He explained some
                        of the decisions which Maltre Linant had cited and in which the apparently
                        adverse views taken were justi- find by the fact that in those particular
                        cases there was no urgency and the attachment was not made on sums of money
                        but on securities.</p>
                    <p>The Judge them closed the hearing, announc- ing that his decision would be
                        given later.</p>
                    <p>This case of the Princes, who are treating the Government as if it were an
                        insolvent debtor, was regarded with great interest, and the small hall of
                        the Refere was inconveniently crowded.</p>

                        Government and to try the case. It annuls the inhibition made by the Princes
                        on the monies of the Daria Sanieh and the Daira Sanieh Company and has
                        ordered these sums to be paid over to the Government on the 16th inst. and
                        condemned the Princes to pay the costs of the hearing. </p>

                    <head>THE GREEK SCHOOLS.</head>
                    <p>Early this summer three or four cases of diphtheria took place among the
                        pupils of the boys and girls' schools of the Hellenic Com- munity of
                        Alexandria. Two little girls died of the disease, and the governing Board
                        promptly disinfected the schools, and closed them at an earlier date than
                        usual, with a view to preventing any epidemic breaking out among the
                        children. The Board, we hear, is not altogether pleased with the action of
                        the Municipality, which has installed a public convenience within a few
                        yards of the windows of the Boys’ School. It seems to us that no worse site
                        could have been chosen for this structure. Its presence must cause
                        considerable discomfort and inconvenience to a large proportion of the 1,500
                        pupils of the schools, which are close together, and may disseminate disease

                    <head>Hamburg-Amerika Line. Amalgamation With Anglo- American.</head>
                    <p>We learn from a reliable source that the negotiations between the
                        Anglo-American Nile Steamer and Hotel Company and the Hamburg America
                        Steamship Company have concluded in an amalgamation under terms which are in
                        every way satisfactory to both parties con- cerned.</p>
                    <p>It is some time ago since Egypt learnt that the Hamburg America Steamship
                        Company was desirous of starting a Nile steamer service and at first it was
                        understood that the venture would be made independently of the com- panies
                        already established, notably Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son, and the company
                        with which they have just come to terces. Some agitation was evinced and the
                        opinion was expressed in some quarters that German enter- price should not
                        be allowed the opportunity of ousting those companies which had a prior
                        right. The matter was taken up in London, and quest- tions were asked in
                        Parliament, but, as is so often the case, no definite answer either satis-
                        factory or otherwise was vouchsafed. </p>
                    <p>Shortly afterwards it was rumoured that the conditions under which Nile
                        traffic is carried on were about to be changed, and that the exchange would
                        in all probability deter any would-be interloper from entering into com-
                        petition with the established companies. Then we learnt that negotiations
                        for the amalgama- ion of the Hamburg-America line with the Anglo-American
                        were pending, and later that arrangements had been made for meetings between
                        the directors of the two companies at Paris or Berlin. We have more than
                        once prophesied the result of these negotiations, and our anticipations now
                        appear to have been well-founded.</p>
                    <p>It cannot, of course, be said with certainty what will be the result of this
                        amalgamation, but it has certainly prevented any serious competition. The
                        Anglo-American line is well- known and is yearly making rapid strics ;
                        strengthened by the valuable support of the strengthened by the valuable
                        support of the Hamburg-America company, with the con- combatant addition to
                        its capital and conse- quent increase of its fleet, it cannot fail to
                        progress still more rapidly. What with the yearly increase of Nile traffic
                        there is plenty scope for two such lines as Messrs. Thomas Cook &amp; Son
                        and the new amalgamation, and we have every hope of seeing a continued im-
                        provident in the already excellent services, without either party suffering
                        from the inevit- able but healthy competition of its rival.</p>

                    <head>ACCIDENT AT BAB-EL-GEDID.</head>
                    <p>On Tuesday evening at 8 o’clock Abdon Effendi Girgis, assistant
                        stationmaster of Alexandria, whilst on duty, mounted an engine with the
                        intention of descending at the north end of the yard to give instructions
                        with regard to the next train which would pass and jumped off before the
                        complete stoppage of the engine, catching his left foot in the wheel. The
                        fore part of his foot was crushed, and he was carried into the station,
                        conscious but b’eeding terribly. Medical assistance was sent for at once and
                        an outside doctor arrived at the same time as the two railway doctors. The
                        rushed part of the foot was immediately amputated while the patient was
                        under the influence of anesthetic. After the operation the injured man was
                        taken to the German hospital, where he is progressing favorably under Dr.
                        Morrison’s care. It is believed that he will be able to walk on the heel of
                        the injured foot.</p>

                        Khargeh and Dakhla Oases, as follows:- The underground artesian supply being
                        practically inexhaustible, the output at the surface may be almost inde-
                        finitely augmented, provided the wells are suunk in suitable localities and
                        kept sufficiently far apart to avoid any appreciable reduction of the
                        hydrostatic pressure. The 0ases lands have one great advantage over those of
                        the Nile Valley in that they are not dependent on the time, volume, and
                        duration of the Nile flood. With proper care and attention the output of
                        wells remains constant,and in several instances wells sunk thousands of
                        years ago by tho Romans and early Egyptians are still yielding over 500
                        gallons a minute.</p>

                    <p>Several improvements and alterations have been effected at this hotel during
                        the summer, which will add greatly to the comfort of visitors. The whole of
                        the shops facing the quay have been removed and in their place a fine dining

                        the bar winter garden, measuring 21 metres by 24 metres, is being laid out.
                        The additions include 32 newly built bedrooms, which will bring up the total
                        to 74. Mr. Kingler, the proprietor, who is also the well known manager of

                        <p>The P. &amp; 0. Osiris arrived this morning soon after dawn and
                            transferred her mails to the waiting Marmora which goes direct through
                            the canal, whereas last week, the mail steamer was obliged to remain
                            some few days, though arrangements had been made for sending on the mail
                            bags as quickly as possible by train. One may say now that the passage
                            of vessels through the canal either way has reached practically a normal
                            condition. To-day ten vessels came up close together and it was somewhat
                            difficult to find berths for them. A few ships have been obliged to tie
                            up further down the canal on account of the strong breeze which has
                            prevailed all night and to-day ; these, with the residue of the third
                            and last fleet, which was in the Bitter lakes yesterday waiting the
                            passage of the outward bound vessels, will, all being well, arrive at
                            this end shortly. Two small British second class cruisers arrived from
                            seaward yesterday and tied up in the Dutch Basin and Rive Asie
                            respectively,having their pilot flags hoisted soon after noon to-day for
                            the canal. The Bibby liner Cheshire, which, owing to the great movement
                            in the harbour early this morning was ordered to anchor in the roads,
                            came in at eleven, and disembarked Mr. Yeilding who had taken passage on
                            the ship from home.</p>

                            ten, and remained for some hours to take in coal, water, and provisions.
                            Those members of the British Association I had the pleasure of seeing
                            spoke most highly of the pleasant time they have had during their

                            afield, as was told in the "Gazette” on Monday. Great regret is
                            expressed by several of them that they did not have the oppotunity of
                            seeing anything of Kibendini and the other equally interesting environs
                            of Mombasa, as their stay was so short in that port, but a party appear

                        <p>The wind came up about 2 p.m. very strong from the N.E., which no doubt
                            accounts for such a poor attendance at the sailing races.</p>
                        <p>At about 4.30 p.m, the representative pairs of the "Club Nautique
                            Francais" and the "Club Internationale Canottieri” started from the
                            breakwater elbow buoy ; the day, on account of the high wind, was not at
                            all an ideal one for rowing races, there being at the starting buoy
                            quite a high sea for such boats.</p>
                        <p>The Canottieri went away in fine style, and from the first had it all
                            their own way, the Francais suffering very much from the inex- perience
                            of their cox, who did not line them up at the start, and during the
                            whole race steered a very bad course. They gave up after going about
                            two-thirds the length of the course, having shipped a good deal of
                            water.</p>
                        <p>The umpire’s launch then took them in tow, but the line appears to have
                            been made fast not to the bow but to one of the seats of the boat. The
                            cox left his post without fixing the rudder, and the boat, getting broad
                            side on to the direction of the tow; promptly filled and capsized ; the
                            crew were rescued by the launch. </p>
                        <p>As the boat was full of water when brought in and had also lost its two
                            sliding seats, the second heat of the competition could not be rowed
                            off, and will therefore take place at 5 p.m. this afternoon.</p>

                    <p>The money market bag again dominated all Stock Exchange values since our
                        last. It is generally recognised that the Bank return during the first days
                        of October, usually shows the reserve to be the smallest of the whole twelve
                        months, and this is accounted for, under normal conditions, by the autumn
                        de- mand for cash throughout the country. This year, however, the heavy
                        foreign withdraw- also of gold and the detaining of large amounts in Egypt
                        have brought the reserve to below 21,000,000 and the proportion of
                        liabilities down to 37 5/5 %. This has had a disquieting effect and has
                        produced a state of nervousness throughout the week, especially as the Bank
                        of Berlin has put its Bank rate up to 5 %. It is felt that unless the Bank
                        rate here is made effective a further advance in the near future will be
                        necessary. There are those who are of opinion that in any ease, owing to the
                        further demands of gold for Egypt and South America, we shall certainly see
                        such an advance before the end of the year. Those who hold this view put
                        forward, in support of their opinion, in addition to the reasons already
                        stated, the fact that Ame- rica is still buying bar gold in the open market
                        here.</p>
                    <p>The above reasons have naturally had a weakening effect upon investment
                        stocks last we wrote, and Conso’s, which on Tuesday were only a shade under
                        89, close today at 88 3/4 for the s/c and 88 1/2 for cash. At the same time,
                        this renewed falling away in prices this afternoon is attributed to some
                        heavy liquidation which is going on, and the low prices touched today are
                        not alone due to the monetary position. The foreign market also has been
                        dull throughout the week, Russians having declined a full point to 94 since
                        our last and the whole list of Japanese stocks having shed 1/8 from last
                        Friday’s quotations. News from Paris seems to con- firm the report of the
                        proposed new Russian loan of £72,000,000, which, it is stated, will be
                        issued simultaneously in England, France, Germany, America, and, possibly,
                        one of the smaller countries, provided the difficulty arising out of the
                        difference in prices, in the various international markets can be overcome
                        so as to permit a common price of issue. Failing this the idea is that the
                        total loan will be reduced to £40,000,000; a 4 % loan at 90.</p>
                    <p>Referring to our remarks above on the money market it is being pointed out
                        that the strong position of Paris, which, in view of this proposed Russian
                        loan it is to the interest of the Paris Bankers to maintain by permitting,
                        if necessary, gold to be sent to London, is an element which should allay
                        the fears of those who anticipate a higher Bank rate.</p>
                    <p>Home rails, although some companies have had most excellent traffic for the
                        past week, have suffered from the prevailing depression owing to the money
                        outlook. Reports from the iron and steel districts are of the most satis-
                        factory and cheerful description. Trade is active and prosperous, all of
                        which means better business for the, railways, especially those in the north
                        which carry heavy minerals. Americans have likewise been scared by the
                        possibility of dearer money, though not to the same extent as home
                        securities. New York anticipated a 4 1/2% rate yesterday, but as soon as it
                        was known that the Directors had made no change prices hardened up all round
                        in the Yankee market. Canadian Pacific shares were on offer, especially
                        after the meeting of the company, with the result of which he share- holders
                        were apparently disappointed, as they had anticipated some reference would
                        be made to the land scheme which, in a large measure, has been the cause of
                        the recent rises. The shares close today at 178 1/2.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian Land and Financial shares remain steady but firm,with very little
                        business doing. Both National and Agricultural Banks main- tain their level,
                        and are quoted to-day at 27 3/5 and 9 respectively.</p>
                    <p>In the mining market the public still keep everely aloof from, South
                        Africans, and Rho- desians are being affected by the general drooping
                        tendency of Kaffirs.</p>
                    <p>There has been little business done, to Egyptian mines. Nile Valleys have
                        weakened somewhat and dose today at*lA a Mpon the week of 1/8. United
