                    <head>THE KHEDIVE.</head>
                    <p>We beg to tender in the name of all Anglo- Egyptians our hearty
                        congratulations to the Khedive of Egypt on the anniversary of his accession.
                        On an occasion like the present it is both customary and opportune to paas
                        in review the chief events of the sovereign's reign. But such a survey would
                        be inadequate without endeavouring to estimate the bearing of such events
                        upon the preeont situation and their probable iufluence on the future. The
                        most important of these events from this point of view, as standing out
                        prominently from among the rest, and as calculated to make his Highness's
                        reign famous even in the lengthy roll of Egypt’s history, are the extension
                        of her dominions by the restoration of her lost provinces in the Sudan and
                        the building of the Assouan Dam. The former has assured to this country
                        durable peace upon her borders and has manifested to the world at large the
                        bravery and capacity of her soldiers when pitted against a most valiant foe.
                        But that brilliant feat of arms has been rivalled, if not surpassed, by the
                        greatest of engineering triumph, which the modern world has witnessed, and
                        which must necessaarily be chief amongst the factors contributing to her
                        future prosperity. These events, even if unaccompanied by many useful
                        ameliorations in almost every department of the Administra- tion, would be
                        sufficient to lend lustre end distinction to his Highness's reign. At a
                        moment like the present, one naturally asks oneself what are the main
                        features of the era inaugurated by the association of the Khedive, and the
                        conclusion suggested is that coming ages will note this epoch as a period of
                        peace- ful progress and prolonged prosperity.</p>
                    <p>Called suddenly to the throne at the age of eighteen, the Khedive was brought
                        face to face with a most difficult situation. But despite his youth and
                        consequent inexperience and the absence of far-seeing eadvirers, his High-
                        ness has risen superior to all the intrigues to which many a ruler of
                        maturer years, though less richly endowed with the qualities of firm- ness,
                        courage, and discrimination, might vary well have succumbed. It is manifest
                        to those, who have closely watched his Highness's career that the dangers by
                        which he was formerly surrounded are now entirely removed, and recent years
                        have shown that the future which awaits him has all the elements of
                        permanent well-being and advancement. Coming to the incidents of the past
                        year, the Anglo- French Agreement signed by the Great Powers of Europe is,
                        impartially considered, an event of paramount significance in that it has
                        rendered signal service in liberating Egypt’s finances from their former
                        shackles and will impart to her institutions a stability which was
                        previously lacking. We must not leave out of account what, in these days, is
                        one of the essentials of statecraft and diplomacy, namely, that the Ruler
                        shall prove himself a social success. The cordial reception given to his
                        Highness by the King, his Ministers, and the cream of our aristocracy, which
                        organised receptions to do him honor, as well as the special marks of favor
                        shown to him by the Sultan on his recent visit to Con- stantinople, afford
                        the most cogent testimony that the Khedive has not failed in this im-
                        portant respect, but is, on the contrary, as wel- come a guest in the West
                        as in the East. Furthermore, if proof were needed of his cordial goodwill
                        towards England, and of his graceful recognition of the services we have
                        rendered to his oountry, bis presences at the Birthday Review is an
                        effective assurance. His urbanity and personal charm have undoubted- ly won
                        for him many sincere frieuds and Ad- mirers in England, where, owing to his
                        frequent visits of late years, he bids fair to be as well known a figure in
                        London society as Edward VII. in Paris, whilst his popularity in Egypt
                        itself is, with every class, ever on the upward grade. If we have accurately
                        gauged the situation and rightly cast the horosoope of coming events, there
                        lies before his Highness Abbas II. a future of such promise as may well be
                        envied by many an ambitious potentate on the European continent, a future,
                        indeed, which should amply satisfy the aspirations of one so practical in
                        his aims and so reasonable in his desires.</p>

                    <p>The establishment of branches of the great European banks in Egypt is viewed
                        with mixed feelings by many financiers here. It is quite possible for a
                        country to have too much loan- able capital, and the recent fall in the
                        price of our staple produce has already set free a con- siderable portion of
                        the temporary capital that is invariably brought to Egypt at this time of
                        the year. A seasonable word of warning is not out of place to those
                        gentlemen who are respon sible for advising their banking houses to come to
                        Egypt, lest by endeavouring to attract custom by lending money too freely,
                        they should add a most unneccesary sti- mulus to this country's overweenig
                        propen sity to speculation. These considerations are not put forward with
                        tho slightest intention of discouraging the introduction of new capital into
                        Egypt, where it is intended to employ it with prudence and foreaght in the
                        develop ment of the commercial and financial interests of Egypt.</p>

                        strike was renewed today, 12,000 men being out. The troops are in readiness
                        to prevent the strike spreading. Five thousand strikers have paraded here
                        today. They induced four other factories to join them, but dispersed quietly
                        on encountering the troops. At the instance of the governors, the

                    <head>THE PORT SAID COLLISION. FULLER DETAILS</head>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent.) <placeName>Port Said</placeName>, Friday. As
                        already reported, a serious collision occurred in Port Said harbour on
                        Thursday afternoon between the Harrison liner, "Crafts- man," of Liverpool,
                        a vessel of some 8,000 tons, and the Norwegian collier, "Congal,” of
                        Sandefjord, bound for Hong Kong with coal. The "Congal,” ready to enter the
                        Canal, was moored fore-and-aft at her berth, but having no breast line out
                        aft,jhad drifted slightly into the fairway. Tbe “Craftsman," from the Canal,
                        in proceeding to her allotted berth, abreast of the Suez Canal Company's
                        offices—which was directly eastern of that of the "Congal,"—passed too near,
                        with the result that a side collision was inevitable, the smaller vessel's
                        msin rigging being touched by the high counter of the "Craftsman,” and the
                        stanchions on the poop bent. The main damage, however, was caused by the
                        propeller blades (three of which are reported to be broken) ripping the
                        plates on the port side of tho “Cougal" below the water line, and causing
                        the vessel to begin to settle down. Tbe Canal authorities, realizing the
                        situa- tion, at once sent tugs to tow the "Congal” in-shore if possible, but
                        the operations were only half completed when she sank at the stem, and the
                        water rushing in, one bulkhead after another gave way till the whole hull
                        was submerged. She now lies in the Bassin Cherif with bridge and boats
                        amidships, a small part of the forecastle deck, and the mast and funnel
                        visible. The crow were able to save most of their effects.</p>

                    <head>SIR W. WILLCOCKS EXPEDITION</head>
                    <p>As we announced a few days ago, <persName>Sir William Willcocks</persName>
                        has returned to Cairo from his important expedition to the Euphrates and the
                        Tigris. He has kindly given us the following statement of the conclusions he
                        has arrived at: The Tigris and Euphrates have apparently enough water to
                        allow of the perennial irriga- tion of 5 million acres and of keeping
                        naviga- tion open to the sea. The hydraulic problems are not so hard as
                        those on the Nile ; but comprehensive projects must be taken up to secure
                        the canals against obliteration by silt, which has often ruined Babylonia. I
                        saw the Tigris in places only 140 feet wide and 6 feet deep,mid the
                        Euphrates 40 feet wide and 3 feet deep, though I measured the water entering
                        Babylonia and found it 50,000 cubic feet per second for tho Tigris, and
                        25,000 cubic feet per second for tho Euphrates. All the existing canals in
                        the Bagdad Pasbalio were ditcharg- ing 500 cubic feet per second between
                        them. The first work needed would be an irrigation and navigation canal some
                        150 foot wide, join- ing the Tigris and Euphrates at Bagdad. This would be
                        easy, as th3 Euphrates is about 15 feet higher than the Tigris. The Hindia
                        Barrage on the Euphrates has so far been a failure, because they have made
                        the same mistake as was made on the Cairo Barrage. I tried to persuade tho
                        engineer (a Son of Mougel Bey, who built the Cairo Bar- race) to act as I
                        acted in Egypt, but he con- sidered the risk too great. Some 100 specimens
                        of soils and building materials and water have been collected by me. When
                        the agricultural experts and chemists have sent in their reports I shall be
                        in a posi- tion to frame estimates. </p>

                    <head>THE PRICE OF MEAT</head>
                    <p>As some misapprehension appears to prevail in regard to the subject of the
                        price of meat and the cold storage system, we may state that in spite of the
                        extra freight for meat landed at Port Said (it actually costs less to send
                        frozen meat from Australia to London than from Australia to Port Said) and
                        for railway car- riage by fast trains, which is absolutely necessary unless
                        the meat is to deteriorate, also for duties, the Nile Cold Storage Com-
                        pany’s prices average only 1d. per lb. more than those given in the London
                        Army and Navy Stores catalogue for 1904. And this though the charges
                        mentioned make the cost of transport nearly 1.5d. per lb. higher, the
                        additional freight charge coming to about a halfpenny per lb. more, while
                        railway charges add an extra .5d. in the lb. and Customs about .3d. As for
                        the retail prices of the butchers in Cairo, they average 12% dearer than
                        those quoted by the Nile Cold Storage Company. Here is an example—for lamb
                        (18 months old as a rule) four Cairo retailers charge P.T. 14, 14, 13, and
                        11 per oke respect- ively, while the company charges for genuine lamb P.T.
                        12 for legs or loins, and P.T. 11 for other parts. In beef, motton, and hams
                        the difference is even more marked.</p>

                    <p>Last night’s performance at the Zizinia Theatre in aid of the El Orwa
                        El-Woska benevolent society was a brilliant success. H.H. the Khedive
                        arrived punctually at 9 p.m. and was received by .H. E. the Governor and the
                        members of the committee of the society. His Highness occupied Baron de
                        Monasoe’s box in company with the Governor, Baron Alfred de Menasce, and
                        several members of tho committee. The appearance of the theatre was
                        magnificent, I the whole of fashionable Alexandria being pre- sent,and the
                        aspect was further enlivened by the band of the society in their brilliant
                        and becom- ing uniforms. The Khedive on several occasions applauded the
                        playing of the young bandsmen. During the intervals his Highness received
                        many European and native notabilities and also all the French comedy
                        artists, who kindly lent their services in aid of the society’s funds. The
                        play, Le monde ou ion sennui, a sparkling comedy by Pailleron, was very ably
                        rendered and is certainly one of the best , performances of the company this
                        season. Mme. Pamy, l’atry, Lily and M1 le.Georgo to Loyer were particularly
                        good. The latter, in the amusing , part of Suzanne de Villiers, was much ap
                        preciated, and was applauded more than once by H.H. the Khedive. Messrs.
                        Cooper and , Laurent also deserve special mention. The net receipts amount
                        to about £300, , and we sincerely hope that it will help to enhance the good
                        this sodety is doing .in the education and moral improvement of the poorer
                        classes of native boys. At present more than 2,000 boys receive instruction

                        appointment of P. M. 0. in Egypt will be filled by the posting of

                        senior medical officer of the Coldstream Guards. lieutenant Colonel Magill
                        entered the medical depart- ment in 1885, and reached his present rank in
                        May, 1896. He is no stranger in Egypt, for he accompanied the Guards Camel
                        Corps in the Nile Expedition 1884-85 and was severely wounded in the fierce
                        action at Abou Klea, near where Colonel Fred Burnaby fell fighting. He was
                        mentioned in despatches, received the medal with two clasps and bronze star.
                        He was with the Coldstreams in tee Boer War, and was present at the actions
                        of Belmont, Easlin, Modder River, Magersfontein, Poplar Grove, Driefontein,
                        Vet River, Zand River, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Diamond Hill, Belfast, and
                        Komati Poort, and the succeeding cam- paign. For his services he was
                        mentioned in despatches, awarded the C. B., medal with six clasps, and
                        King’s medal with two clasps.</p>
                    <p>The army council, despite much hostile criticism, has determined to withdraw
                        the 56th battery R.F.A. and No. 4 mountain battery from egypt. The field
                        battery will return home in march. The army council is pushing retrenchment
                        to the very verge of safety.</p>
                    <p>We have the authority of <persName>Mr. Arnold Forster</persName> for stating
                        that 120 of the new 18.5 pounder field guns—just sofficient to arm 20.
                        batteries—are now ready and that 500 more will be delivered in 1906. That is
                        a great hiatus. If 120 guns can be produced for India in a few weeks, why
                        wait newly two years for the balance? The haste in providing guns for India
                        is based on Mr. Balfour's now historic statement that "the problem of the
                        British Army is the problem of tee defence of Afghanistan."</p>
                    <p>The battleship “Illustrious" has arrived at Portsmouth to have one of her
                        12-inch bar- bette guns replaced by a new one.</p>
                    <p>One of the objections to the late distribu- tion of the fleet was that in a
                        great number of foreign countries the tremendous naval power of Great
                        Britain was not fully enough realised. On many shores a small cruiser or
                        obsolete gunboat represented —or rather misrepresented —the premier naval
                        power. That will now be all changed. The second cruiser squadron, which
                        consists of eight powerful 24-knot ar- moured cruisers under the command of
                            <persName>Admiral Prince Louie of Battenberg</persName>—who has just
                        hoisted his flag on the swiftest cruiser afloat, the “Drake”—has been
                        detailed for a seven months’ cruise along the coast line of North and South
                        America. Every port of importance will be visited, and the naval might of
                        the Empire practically demonstrated. The selection of the “Drake” as
                        flagship was a happy one, perpetuating as it does the name of that grim old
                        sea dog who was the terror of our enemies on the "Spanish main."</p>

                    <p>The news that the company at Alexaxdria and the detachment at Cairo of the
                        Royal Malta Artillery are leaving Egypt for their native isle has been
                        received with much regret, as during the five years the R.M. A. have been in
                        Egypt they have made themselves very popular. They came here in January,
                        1900, two companies having been raised in Malta for service abroad, and one
                        was sent to Egypt. Nothing is known as to the future of the company now in
                        Egypt, and it is doubtful whether they are to be stationed permanently in
                        Malta, or to be posted to some foreign station. Since the R. M. A. came to
                        Egypt they have been under the command of Major Balbi. The troops are
                        leaving on the 4th proxo. by the “Di wara.”</p>

                    <p>A great many people appear to be quite unaware of the position of the
                        Egyptian Hotels, imited, which company owns the Ghezireh Palace and
                        Shepheard’s Hotel. We are authorised to state that this company, as it
                        present constituted, is an English company and is registered under the
                        Companies Acts. its board is composed as follows. Chairman : Lord Claude
                        Hamilton, the Chairman of the Treat Eastern Railway Company ; members of die
                        board: Sir Robert Herbert, Mr. Emmanuel J. Zervudacchi, Mr. E. A. Harrison
                        (general manager of Messrs. Thos. Cook and 800, Limit- ed), and Mr. J. J.
                        Hug, of Cairo. The London offices of the company are at 3, Lothbury, EC. Up
                        to last spring the Compagnie Internationale des' Grands Hotels was the
                        largest shareholder in the Egyptian Hotels Company. The former company was
                        bought out entirely by .Mr. Charles Baehler, who is backed by a powerful
                        financial syndicate. He therefore is now in control of the destinies of the
                        company, and with the assistance of his board, some of whose members have
                        great local experience, he should make the company, under its new
                        conditions, even more successful than it was before. Owing to the rise in
                        the price of land, especially for building purposes in the neigh- bourhood
                        of Cairo, the property belonging to this company at Ghezireh has become a
                        very valuable asset, The company intend to develop the Ghezireh estate into
                        one of the finest residential quarters of Cairo. Already thirty- two villas
                        have been built and some very high offers have been recently made for suites
                        at Ghezireh. The fashionable neighbourhood of this estate, and its proximity
                        to the Ghezireh Palace Hotel, with its beautiful park and the Khedi- vial
                        Spotting Club, already combine to make It a much aought after spot for
                        residences.</p>
