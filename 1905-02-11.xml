                       <head>THE KHEDIVE.</head>
                       <p>We beg to tender in the name of all Anglo-
                       Egyptians our hearty congratulations to the
                       Khedive of Egypt on the anniversary of
                       his accession. On an occasion like the present
                       it is both customary and opportune to paas in
                       review the chief events of the sovereign's
                       reign. But such a survey would be inadequate
                       without endeavouring to estimate the bearing
                       of such events upon the preeont situation and
                       their probable iufluence on the future. The
                       most important of these events from this point
                       of view, as standing out prominently from
                       among the rest, and as calculated to make his
                       Highness's reign famous even in the lengthy
                       roll of Egypt’s history, are the extension of
                       her dominions by the restoration of her lost
                       provinces in the Sudan and the building of
                       the Assouan Dam. The former has assured to
                       this country durable peace upon her borders
                       and has manifested to the world at large the
                       bravery and capacity of her soldiers when
                       pitted against a most valiant foe. But that
                       brilliant feat of arms has been rivalled, if
                       not surpassed, by the greatest of engineering
                       triumph, which the modern world has 
                       witnessed, and which must necessaarily be
                       chief amongst the factors contributing to
                       her future prosperity. These events, even if
                       unaccompanied by many useful ameliorations
                       in almost every department of the Administra-
                       tion, would be sufficient to lend lustre end
                       distinction to his Highness's reign. At a
                       moment like the present, one naturally asks
                       oneself what are the main features of the era
                       inaugurated by the association of the Khedive,
                       and the conclusion suggested is that coming
                       ages will note this epoch as a period of peace-
                       ful progress and prolonged prosperity.</p>
                       <p>Called suddenly to the throne at the age of
                       eighteen, the Khedive was brought face to face
                       with a most difficult situation. But despite
                       his youth and consequent inexperience and
                       the absence of far-seeing eadvirers, his High-
                       ness has risen superior to all the intrigues to
                       which many a ruler of maturer years, though
                       less richly endowed with the qualities of firm-
                       ness, courage, and discrimination, might vary
                       well have succumbed. It is manifest to those,
                       who have closely watched his Highness's
                       career that the dangers by which he was
                       formerly surrounded are now entirely removed,
                       and recent years have shown that the future
                       which awaits him has all the elements of
                       permanent well-being and advancement. Coming
                       to the incidents of the past year, the Anglo-
                       French Agreement signed by the Great Powers
                       of Europe is, impartially considered, an
                       event of paramount significance in that
                       it has rendered signal service in liberating
                       Egypt’s finances from their former shackles
                       and will impart to her institutions a
                       stability which was previously lacking. We
                       must not leave out of account what, in
                       these days, is one of the essentials of statecraft
                       and diplomacy, namely, that the Ruler shall
                       prove himself a social success. The cordial
                       reception given to his Highness by the King,
                       his Ministers, and the cream of our aristocracy,
                       which organised receptions to do  him honor,
                       as well as the special marks of favor shown to
                       him by the Sultan on his recent visit to Con-
                       stantinople, afford the most cogent testimony
                       that the Khedive has not failed in this im-
                       portant respect, but is, on the contrary, as wel-
                       come a guest in the West as in the East.
                       Furthermore, if proof were needed of his
                       cordial goodwill towards England, and of his
                       graceful recognition of the services we have
                       rendered to his oountry, bis presences at the
                       Birthday Review is an effective assurance. His
                       urbanity and personal charm have undoubted-
                       ly won for him many sincere frieuds and Ad-
                       mirers in England, where, owing to his
                       frequent visits of late years, he bids fair to be
                       as well known a figure in London society as
                       Edward VII. in Paris, whilst his popularity in
                       Egypt itself is, with every class, ever on the
                       upward grade. If we have accurately gauged
                       the situation and rightly cast the horosoope of
                       coming events, there lies before his Highness
                       Abbas II. a future of such promise as may well
                       be envied by many an ambitious potentate on the
                       European continent, a future, indeed, which
                       should amply satisfy the aspirations of one so
                       practical in his aims and so reasonable in his
                       desires.</p>

                           <p>The establishment of branches of the great
                           European banks in Egypt is viewed with mixed
                           feelings by many financiers here. It is quite
                           possible for a country to have too much loan-
                           able capital, and the recent fall in the price of
                           our staple produce has already set free a con-
                           siderable portion of the temporary capital that
                           is invariably brought to Egypt at this time of
                           the year. A seasonable word of warning is not
                           out of place to those gentlemen who are respon
                           sible for advising their banking houses to
                           come to Egypt, lest by endeavouring to
                           attract custom by lending money too freely,
                           they should add a most unneccesary sti-

One thousand, five hundred strikers of
                      <placeName>Sosnowice</placeName>, seeing the catherine works illuminated,
thought that work was proceeding.
They started towards the building, when the
soldiers fired from the windows, hitting many
of the strikers.  (Reuter.)</p>
                  <p><placeName>St. Petersburg</placeName>, February 10
The men of the putiloff and franco russian
works here have started an eight hours day on
their own account.  As the employers have
refused to countenance the movement, the
strike was renewed today, 12,000 men being
out.  The troops are in readiness to prevent 
the strike spreading.
Five thousand strikers have paraded here
today.  They induced four other factories to
join them, but dispersed quietly on encountering
the troops.
At the instance of the governors, the manufacturers
of warsaw and the mine owners at sosnowice are
conferring with a view to making concessions.  (Reuter.)</p>

                      There was a fresh collision at <placeName>sosnowice</placeName> last
night with the troops.  The latter fired on the
moh as the strikers were extinguishing the
smelting furnace.  One hundred persons were
killed or wounded.  (Reuter.)</p>
                  <p><placeName>St. Petersburg</placeName>, February 10
A strike has been declared in the Putiloff

                        rigging being touched by the high counter of
                        the "Craftsman,” and the stanchions on the
                        poop bent. The main damage, however, was
                        caused by the propeller blades (three of which
                        are reported to be broken) ripping the plates on
                        the port side of tho “Cougal" below the water
                        line, and causing the vessel to begin to settle
                        down.
                        Tbe Canal authorities, realizing the situa-
                        tion, at once sent tugs to tow the "Congal”
                        in-shore if possible, but the operations were
                        only half completed when she sank at the stem,
                        and the water rushing in, one bulkhead after
                        another gave way till the whole hull was
                        submerged. She now lies in the Bassin Cherif
                        with bridge and boats amidships, a small part
                        of the forecastle deck, and the mast and
                        funnel visible. The crow were able to save most
                        of their effects.</p></div>

                    <head>SIR W. WILLCOCKS EXPEDITION</head>
                    <p>As we announced a few days ago, <persName>Sir William
                         Willcocks</persName> has returned to Cairo from his
                        important expedition to the Euphrates and the
                        Tigris. He has kindly given us the following 
                        statement of the conclusions he has arrived
                        at:
                        The Tigris and Euphrates have apparently 
                        enough water to allow of the perennial irriga-
                        tion of 5 million acres and of keeping naviga-
                        tion open to the sea. The hydraulic problems
                        are not so hard as those on the Nile ; but
                        comprehensive projects must be taken up to 
                        secure the canals against obliteration by silt,
                        which has often ruined Babylonia. I saw the 
                        Tigris in places only 140 feet wide and 6 feet 
                        deep,mid the Euphrates 40 feet wide and 3 feet
                        deep, though I measured the water entering
                        Babylonia and found it 50,000 cubic feet per
                        second for tho Tigris, and 25,000 cubic feet per
                        second for tho Euphrates. All the existing 
                        canals in the Bagdad Pasbalio were ditcharg-
                        ing 500 cubic feet per second between them. 
                        The first work needed would be an irrigation 
                        and navigation canal some 150 foot wide, join-
                        ing the Tigris and Euphrates at Bagdad. This
                        would be easy, as th3 Euphrates is about 15
                        feet higher than the Tigris.
                        The Hindia Barrage on the Euphrates has 
                        so far been a failure, because they have made 
                        the same mistake as was made on the Cairo 
                        Barrage. I tried to persuade tho engineer (a 
                        Son of Mougel Bey, who built the Cairo Bar- 
                        race) to act as I acted in Egypt, but he con- 
                        sidered the risk too great.	
                        Some 100 specimens of soils and building 
                        materials and water have been collected by me.
                        When the agricultural experts and chemists 
                        have sent in their reports I shall be in a posi- 
                        tion to frame estimates.	</p></div>

                    <head>THE PRICE OF MEAT</head>
                    <p>As some misapprehension appears to prevail 
                        in regard to tbe subject of the price of meat 
                        and the cold storage system, we may state that 
                        in spite of the extra freight for meat landed 
                        at Port Said (it actually costs less to send 
                        frozen meat from Australia to London than 
                        from Australia to Port Said) and for railway car-
                        riage by fast trains, which is absolutely 
                        necessary unless the meat is to deteriorate,
                        also for duties, the Nile Cold Storage Com-
                        pany’s prices average only 1d. per lb. more
                        than those given in the London Army and
                        Navy Stores catalogue for 1904. And this
                        though the charges mentioned make the
                        cost of transport nearly 1.5d. per lb. higher,
                        the additional freight charge coming to about
                        a halfpenny per lb. more, while railway
                        charges add an extra .5d. in the lb. and
                        Customs about .3d. As for the retail prices of
                        the butchers in Cairo, they average 12% dearer
                        than those quoted by the Nile Cold Storage
                        Company. Here is an example—for lamb
                        (18 months old as a rule) four Cairo retailers
                        charge P.T. 14, 14, 13, and 11 per oke respect-
                        ively, while the company charges for genuine
                        lamb P.T. 12 for legs or loins, and P.T. 11 for
                        other parts. In beef, motton, and hams the
                        difference is even more marked.</p></div>

                        the Khedive arrived punctually at 9 p.m. and
                        was received by .H. E. the Governor and the 
                        members of the committee of the society. His 
                        Highness occupied Baron de Monasoe’s box in
                        company with the Governor, Baron Alfred de
                        Menasce, and several members of tho committee. 
                        The appearance of the theatre was magnificent, I
                        the whole of fashionable Alexandria being pre-
                        sent,and the aspect was further enlivened by the 
                        band of the society in their brilliant and becom-
                        ing uniforms. The Khedive on several occasions 
                        applauded the playing of the young bandsmen. 
                        During the intervals his Highness received 
                        many European and native notabilities and 
                        also all the French comedy artists, who 
                        kindly lent their services in aid of the society’s 
                        funds. The play, Le monde ou ion sennui, 
                        a sparkling comedy by Pailleron, was very 
                        ably rendered and is certainly one of the best ,
                        performances of the company this season. Mme.

                        criticism, has determined to withdraw the 56th
                        battery R.F.A. and No. 4 mountain battery 
                        from egypt.  The field battery will return home
                        in march.  The army council is pushing 
                        retrenchment to the very verge of safety.</p>
                    <p>We have the authority of <persName>Mr. Arnold 
                        Forster</persName> for stating that 120 of the new 18.5
                        pounder field guns—just sofficient to arm 20.
                        batteries—are now ready and that 500 more
                        will be delivered in 1906. That is a great
                        hiatus. If 120 guns can be produced for India
                        in a few weeks, why wait newly two years for
                        the balance? The haste in providing guns for
                        India is based on Mr. Balfour's now historic
                        statement that "the problem of the British
                        Army is the problem of tee defence of
                        Afghanistan."</p>
                    <p>The battleship “Illustrious" has arrived at
                        Portsmouth to have one of her 12-inch bar-
                        bette guns replaced by a new one.</p>
                    <p>One of the objections to the late distribu-
                        tion of the fleet was that in a great number of
                        foreign countries the tremendous naval power
                        of Great Britain was not fully enough realised.
                        On many shores a small cruiser or obsolete
                        gunboat represented —or rather misrepresented
                        —the premier naval power. That will now be
                        all changed. The second cruiser squadron, 
                        which consists of eight powerful 24-knot ar-
                        moured cruisers under the command of 
                        <persName>Admiral Prince Louie of Battenberg</persName>—who has
                        just hoisted his flag on the swiftest cruiser
                        afloat, the “Drake”—has been detailed for a
                        seven months’ cruise along tbe coast line of
                        North and South America. Every port of
                        importance will be visited, and the naval might
                        of the Empire practically demonstrated. The
                        selection of the “Drake” as flagship was a
                        happy one, perpetuating as it does the name
                        of that grim old sea dog who was the terror of
                        our enemies on the "Spanish main."</p></div>

                    <head>ROYAL MALTA ARTILLERY</head>
                    <p>The news that the company at Alexaxdria
                        and the detachment at Cairo of the Royal
                        Malta Artillery are leaving Egypt for their
                        native isle has been received with much
                        regret, as during the five years the
                        R.M. A. have been in Egypt they have
                        made themselves very popular. They came
                        here in January, 1900, two companies having
                        been raised in Malta for service abroad, and
                        one was sent to Egypt.
                        Nothing is known as to the future of the
                        company now in Egypt, and it is doubtful
                        whether they are to be stationed permanently
                        in Malta, or to be posted to some foreign
                        station. Since the R. M. A. came to Egypt
                        they have been under tbe command of Major
                        Balbi. The troops are leaving on the 4th

                    <head>EGYPTIAN HOTELS LIMITED</head>
                    <p>A great many people appear to be quite
                        unaware of the position of the Egyptian Hotels,
                        imited, which company owns the Ghezireh
                        Palace and Shepheard’s Hotel. We are
                        authorised to state that this company, as
                        it present constituted, is an English company
                        and is registered under the Companies Acts.
                        its board is composed as follows. Chairman :
                        Lord Claude Hamilton, the Chairman of the
                        Treat Eastern Railway Company ; members of
                        die board: Sir Robert Herbert, Mr. Emmanuel
                        J. Zervudacchi, Mr. E. A. Harrison (general
                        manager of Messrs. Thos. Cook and 800, Limit-
                        ed), and Mr. J. J. Hug, of Cairo. The London
                        offices of the company are at 3, Lothbury, EC.
                        Up to last spring the Compagnie Interna-
                        tionale des' Grands Hotels was the largest
                        shareholder in the Egyptian Hotels Company.
                        The former company was bought out entirely
                        by .Mr. Charles Baehler, who is backed by a
                        powerful financial syndicate. He therefore is
                        now in control of the destinies of the company,
                        and with the assistance of his board, some of
                        whose members have great local experience, 
                        he should make the company, under its new
                        conditions, even more successful than it was
                        before.
                       Owing to the rise in the price of land,
                        especially for building purposes in the neigh-
                        bourhood of Cairo, the property belonging to
                        this company at Ghezireh has become a very
                        valuable asset, The company intend to develop
                        the Ghezireh estate into one of the finest
                        residential quarters of Cairo. Already thirty-
                        two villas have been built and some very high
                        offers have been recently made for suites at
                        Ghezireh.
                       The fashionable neighbourhood of this estate,
                        and its proximity to the Ghezireh Palace
                        Hotel, with its beautiful park and the Khedi-
                        vial Spotting Club, already combine to make
                        It a much aought after spot for residences.</p>
