					<dateline><placeName>London</placeName>, Friday, Nor. 3.</dateline>
					<p>We understand that, though nothing has been definitely settled, the new
						lunatic asylum will probably not be constructed near the desert edge west of
						Damanhour, in the Behera Province, as was previously expected. The Behera
						site had certain disadvantages, chief among them the absence of stone
						quarries which would have greatly increased the cost of construction,a brick
						building costing at least twice as much as one constructed of local building
						stone, many good varieties of which are available and abundant, especially
						near the edge of the <placeName>Eastern (Arabian) desert</placeName>. </p>
					<p>The choice of a site at <placeName>Khanka</placeName>, a lew miles beyond
						Khanka, is now being discussed, and we understand that <persName>Sir Horace
							Pinching Pasha</persName>, <persName>Dr. Warnock</persName>, and
							<persName>Mr. Courtenay Clifton</persName>, the first two representing
						the Sanitary Department and the latter the Ministry of Public Works, will
						proceed next week to the spot from Marg and examine the proposed site. The
						new asylum will probably be built in the hard desert fairly near Khanka—if
						built in the neighbourhood of Cairo at all—where there are water wells which
						yield a good supply, and abundance of building stone is within easy reach.
						The climate of Khanka is good, and the town, which was at one time a fairly
						important centre, but is said to have been declining recently, may well
						benefit by the construction of‘the asylum, especially if the Marg-Matarieh
						railway, as was formerly proposed, is prolonged from Marg to Khanka. The
						embankments for part at least of the intervening distance were laid down and
						rails and embankment alike reach Alag some two miles N. E. of Marg and a
						little less than one-third of the way to Khanka. </p>
					<p><persName>Sir Peroy Girouard</persName>, it will be remembered, at one time
						contemplated the extension of the Cairo-Marg line through Khanka to the
						well-known Abou-Zaabel stone quarries. </p>

					<head>BUILDING SITES AND SANITATION.</head>
					<p>Our attention has been called by some of our readers to one of the most
						unpleasant accompaniments of building activity at Cairo. </p>
					<p>To put the matter plainly, in far too many cases, no conveniences of any sort
						are supplied for the use of the workmen, with the result that an amount of
						filth is allowed to be spread broadcast in the neighbourhood of these
						buildings, which is bound to have a prejudicial effect on the health or at
						least on the comfort of the neighbourhood Dead dogs and cats and other offal
						are frequently thrown into these sites and may remain there for two or three
						days, festering and horrible, to the disgust of passers-by. Would it be
						impossible for the Sanitary Department to force contractors to provide
						latrines, eta, for the use of the workmen, which could be cleared out from
						time to time by carts? A rule of this sort has long been applied to all such
						cases in the British Islands, and has proved a decided success from the
						point of view of the comfort and health of all concerned. </p>
